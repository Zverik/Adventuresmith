    The beast takes complete control and you are temporarily
    controlled by the GM as an NPC. You lose both your
    ability to speak and to use tools.
    <br/><br/>You immediately run away into the wilderness and must
    Fight whoever tries to stop you. You regain control of
    your character only when someone Heals you – but that
    is only possible after D6 hours. Once you regain your
    senses you have developed another animal power of
    your choosing
  - |
    You must immediately either run away or Fight against
    an individual of your choosing, friend or foe, until you or
    your opponent is broken. After that, you lose your ability
    to speak and to use tools.
  - |
    You temporarily lose your capacity for coherent, logical
    thinking.
    <br/><br/>You lose the ability to form human words and can only
    communicate through primitive animal sounds.
    You are also completely unable to use tools.
    <br/><br/>You also lose the ability to use the skill Comprehend.
    The effect lasts D6 days.

    You lose the ability to form human words and can only
    communicate through primitive animal sounds. You can
    still use all your skills. <br/><br/>To simulate this effect, you as a
    player should also stop speaking, other than to describe
    the actions of your animal. After D6 days you regain the
    ability to speak.

    Your animal side is completely suppressed, and your
    human side takes over.
    <br/><br/>This means you lose all your FP
    and are unable to gain more. You can push as usual, but
    won’t gain any FP. You cannot use the Dominate skill. The
    effect lasts D6 days.

    You connect with your inner beast, and for a moment
    it acts in perfect harmony with your human side.

    <br/><br/>You regain the FP you just spent and can immediately, in the
    same turn, activate the same power again – with the
    same purpose as the first time, or another.
