    GM decides what has happened to the expedition – and
    if someone or something has followed the survivors back
    to the Ark.

    The entire expedition returns to the Ark, having failed
    to reach the target sector. <br/><br/>Something has forced them to
    turn back – the GM decides what.

    Nothing is heard from the expedition, and rumors
    spread in the Ark regarding its fate. <br/><br/>Roll again on this
    table in the next gaming session. If you roll this result

    comes back. Its actual fate is up to the GM to decide.

    (the GM decides which) is increased by 2D6.
