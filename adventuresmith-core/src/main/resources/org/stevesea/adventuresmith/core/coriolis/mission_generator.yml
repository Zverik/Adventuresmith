  rewards:
    New_contract: <strong>New contract:</strong> The group secures a new contract if they carry out the current mission or voyage well (the GM decides). A new contract means 20% more payment for the next mission.
    Favor:  <strong>Favor:</strong> The group can ask their employer for a favor at a later time. The nature of the favor could be specified when they accept the mission or be determined later. The effect should be powerful, equivalent of a strong Icon talent.
    Birr:  <strong>Birr:</strong> The group gets a big monetary reward plus expenses paid. For Easy missions they get D6 thousand birr, 2D6 for Normal missions and 3D6 for Hard ones.
    Gear:  <strong>Gear:</strong> The group gets some kind of gear they need. It could be weapons, armor or some other special equipment. Not necessarily one set/piece per PC.
    Ship_module/feature:  <strong>Ship module/feature:</strong> The group can choose one new module or feature for their ship as reward.
    License:  <strong>License:</strong> The group acquires a license for some kind of gear, enabling them to purchase it. It could be heavy firearms, certain kinds of torpedoes or some other restricted tech. The license might be valid only once or a few times and maybe only in one location (the GM decides).
    Cybernetics/Bionics:  <strong>Cybernetics/Bionics:</strong> The group or an individual PC gets a free cybernetic mod or bionic sculpt, but must spend XP on it as usual.
    Medal_of_honor: |
      <strong>Medal of honor:</strong>
      The group receives a medal of honor that gives them a +1 in all situations where having the medal may be beneficial
      (usually affecting MANIPULATION). When interacting with persons or groups with the same background as the
      medal, the modifier becomes +3 and might earn the PCs extra favors (the GM decides). A medal should feel like a
      powerful reward. Additional medals increase the bonus by 1.
    Expedition_of_their_own: |
      <strong>Expedition of their own:</strong>
      The group is guaranteed funding for an expedition of their own. This includes all expenses as well as a debt payment
      during the time the expedition is scheduled to take.
    Vehicle:  <strong>Vehicle:</strong> The group gets a new vehicle, up to a small shuttle but no proper spaceships.
    New_knowledge:  <strong>New knowledge:</strong> The group gets access to important knowledge that could lead them on new adventures or be connected to a PC's past.
    Artifact:  <strong>Artifact:</strong> The group receives an artifact. This reward could well prove to be a double-edged sword
    Holy_relic/artifact: |
      <strong>Holy relic/artifact:</strong> The group gets a holy relic or an artifact of religious significance to Icon believers. The relic should have a specific
      effect with a +3 modifier on rare occasions without generating DPs. Artifacts could be chosen from the list above,
      but should be given a religious interpretation.
    New_scrap_ship/colony: |
      <strong>New scrap ship/colony:</strong> The group is rewarded with a new scrap ship. It is as close to a wreck as one can get but with a working bridge,
      reactor and graviton projector. All other modules are damaged or missing. The ship can be restored with new
      modules and a lot of birr. In some cases, this reward could be a small colony with a few buildings and an attached
      claim, mine or forested area or adjacent farmlands.
    New_voyage_funded:   <strong>New voyage funded:</strong> The pilgrim group gets the next voyage funded, plus one segment of debt cancellation.
    New_play_funded:  <strong>New play funded:</strong> The entertainer group gets a play, a concert, a movie or a circus tour funded, plus one segment of debt cancellation.
    New_colony_funded:  <strong>New colony funded:</strong> The nomad/plebeian group gets a new colony funded, but they must build it themselves.
    Temple_constructed: |
      <strong>Temple constructed:</strong> The group gets a temple erected in their honor. This gives them a +3 in appropriate situations when interacting
      with people in the same system, and a +1 in other systems. The modifier wears off after D6 segments. Additional
      temples during the D6 segments increase the bonus by 1.
    Fame: |
      <strong>Fame:</strong> The group becomes famous for something they have done and receives a +3 in all appropriate situations for one
      segment. They will also be recognized more often, which is not always a good thing.
    Absolution/blessing: |
      <strong>Absolution/blessing:</strong> The group receives a pardon, which is very good if they have done something wicked or evil. A blessing gives a +3
      modifier in specific situations connected to the field and skills of one Icon.
    Faction_reputation:  <strong>Faction reputation:</strong> The group's reputation with a faction increases and they get a +3 when negotiating with that faction for one segment.
    Faction_protection: |
      <strong>Faction protection:</strong> The group comes under the protection of a faction and can ask the faction for one favor if they get into trouble. The
      protection also means that hostile factions take notice of the group.
    Discount_on_new_goods: |
      <strong>Discount on new goods:</strong> The group receives a discount on one type of goods on their next trade run and can make a 20% higher profit on
      that sale, complications not accounted for.
    Faction_contact: |
      <strong>Faction contact:</strong> The group gets a contact within a faction that can give them new trade missions where the PCs can choose between
      a few different goods. They get a +3 when negotiating for these goods for D6 segments.
    Extra_debt_cancellation:  <strong>Extra debt cancellation:</strong> The group gets D6 segments of debt cancellation plus expenses paid.
