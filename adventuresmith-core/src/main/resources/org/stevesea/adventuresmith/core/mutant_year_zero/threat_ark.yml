  <h5>Boss vs Boss</h5>
  A Boss sees an opportunity to become top dog. During
  one bloody night, she tries to wipe out all of
  her competition and become the sole ruler of the
  Ark. But one of her rivals survives, and launches a
  counter-offensive. No one in the Ark is unaffected
  – if you don’t pick a side, no one will protect you
  against the raging violence.
  <br/><br/>* Both rivaling Bosses try to recruit the PCs to
  their cause – with force, if necessary. PCs can
  end up on opposing sides.
  <br/><br/>* A third Boss preaches calm and unity, and
  wins the People’s support. Soon, he is targeted
  in an assassination attempt. The PCs
  can carry out the deed or try to stop it.
  <br/><br/>* Finally, the Elder steps forward and speaks to
  the People. But is it too late to stop the violence,
  will the People listen?
- |
  <h5>A Child of the People</h5>
  The Slave Sira has complained of stomach pains
  for some time, but who cares about a Slave? Now
  everyone cares. They say that Sira will give birth to
  a child. The news spreads like wildfire in the Ark. If
  it’s true, it’s the first time that anyone can remember
  that a child is born to the People.
  <br/><br/>* A violent power-struggle erupts between
  Bosses who want to claim Sira and her unborn
  child for themselves. She quickly becomes
  a symbol of the People’s future. Someone
  might try to kidnap her – or hire the PCs
  to do it.
  <br/><br/>* Sira refuses to say who the father is. Perhaps
  it’s a mutant in the Ark, and the conception is
  just a random accident of nature. Or the father
  is someone from outside, like The Man on the
  Beach (page 148), one of the Wanderers (page
  152) or even a Zone-Ghoul (page 176).
  <br/><br/>* After some time, Sira gives birth. The People
  celebrate, but the joy doesn’t last. The baby
  is ill. Maybe there is a cure somewhere in the
  Zone? In the meantime, the rivalry continues
  between Bosses who want to take care of Sira
  and the child. She might react by fleeing the
  Ark – and if she does, she will be hunted.
- |
  <h5>The Derelict Oil Rig</h5>
  Through the thick fog of the Zone it comes floating
  slowly – a gigantic rusting metal hulk. The fourlegged
  oil platform, as tall as the ruins at the heart
  of the Zone, beaches and casts its ominous shadow
  over the Ark. What secrets could be hidden inside it?
  <br/><br/>* Someone, preferably PCs, climb on board the
  oil rig. They find several artifacts, but also
  dozens of corpses. Strangely enough, they
  seem to have been beaten to death – very
  recently. Some are still warm. The dead
  don’t seem to be mutants, but some carry
  deformations.
  <br/><br/>* Log books show that the crew has lived on
  the oil rig for generations – may ever since
  the Fall. This find may make the players wonder
  about the People’s own origin – how and
  when did they actually come to the Ark?
  <br/><br/>* Deep inside the oil rig, there is a survivor. He
  is completely out of his mind and is guilty of
  killing the others. He now stalks the intruders
  and tries to kill them off one by one. If caught,
  he rambles on about “Project Eden” and
  seems terrified of the mutants.
- |
  <h5>The Helldrivers</h5>
  It sounds like a thunderstorm in the distance. But
  coming closer, the noise turns into the loud revving
  of powerful engines, and every mutant in the
  Ark runs to see what is coming. Dozens of cars and
  motorcycles with grim drivers and riders roll up
  to the gates. Stalkers have told stories about the
  fearsome Helldrivers, few thought they were real.
  Now, they are here.
  <br/><br/>* The Helldrivers (page 173) besiege the Ark.
  They demand booze and grub in return for
  not burning to the Ark to the ground with
  their mounted flamethrowers.
  <br/><br/>* The Helldrivers try to recruit a PC, or an NPC
  with a relationship to a PC.
  <br/><br/>* The situation sooner or later escalates to
  open violence – unless the Helldrivers
  can be persuaded to leave, or somehow be
  out-maneuvered.
- |
  <h5>The Hunger</h5>
  Grub has been scarce in the Ark for some time, but
  now the situation is truly desperate. The stockpile
  of canned food is gone, and every mutant has to
  find their own means to feed themselves. Starvation
  sets in and the fight for grub will be brutal.
  <br/><br/>* Desperate fights over grub erupt all over the
  Ark. Riots break out. Someone tries to steal a
  PC’s grub.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss tries to steal what little food the Elder
  and his circle of Chroniclers still have. The
  PCs might be hired for the job, or try to stop it.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss has a radical solution to the problem.
  If there is nothing else to eat, the People
  must consume – each other. But who will be
  sacrificed?
- |
  <h5>The Killing Machine</h5>
  A small Zone expedition returns, bloody and exhausted.
  Several members of the group have been
  killed, and the survivors are delirious. They claim
  to have been attacked by a walking machine. Has
  the Rot driven them all insane?
  <br/><br/>* A Boss with an interest in the Old Age wants
  to know more about the machine, and organizes
  a hunting expedition. The PCs are invited
  to join.
  <br/><br/>* Another faction in the Zone (Chapter 13) is
  also hunting for the machine. As you may
  have guessed, it is a robot. Maybe there are
  more of them out there?
  <br/><br/>* The hunt for the robot could end in a dramatic
  showdown. Perhaps the machine can
  show the way to a hidden bunker?
- |
  <h5>The Last Drop</h5>
  The water source in the Ark fails. The well goes
  dry, the water purifier breaks down or the cistern
  bursts – whatever the reason, it’s a disaster. Whatever
  Rot-free water is left in cans and bottles will
  only last a few days.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss tries to take control of what little water
  is left. Things get violent.
  <br/><br/>* Dehydrated mutants turn to drinking rotwater
  from puddles and streams, and Rot fever
  spreads in the Ark.
  <br/><br/>* In the end, the People have no other choice
  than to find a new water source – or spare
  parts if they can fix the old one.
- |
  <h5>Lost Treasure</h5>
  An expensive and important item in the Ark has
  disappeared without a trace. It can be something
  the People have built: a tool, a spare part, or an
  artifact from the Old Age. The item has been stolen
  in the dead of night. Now, everyone suspects
  everyone else.
  <br/><br/>* A PC, or an NPC with a relationship to a PC,
  is accused of the theft.
  <br/><br/>* A PC learns who is behind the theft. What
  does he do with this information?
  <br/><br/>* The perpetrator – or someone who is unjustly
  accused – flees the Ark. A lynch mob is organized
  to find him.
- |
  <h5>The Man on the Beach</h5>
  No one knows where the man without memory
  came from. One cold morning he lies shivering
  with hypothermia on a beach near the Ark, where
  some scavengers find him. He speaks in a strange,
  foreign accent, but manages to explain that he can’t
  remember who he is. Apart from a worn coverall
  with strange markings, there are no clues to his
  origin. He seems to lack all mutations.
  <br/><br/>* The stranger’s arrival causes a great stir in
  the Ark. Several Bosses want to lock him up
  and question him. The Chroniclers of the
  Dawn Vault want to talk to him. The struggle
  over what to do with him could turn violent.
  <br/><br/>* The man is confused, but step by step, his
  memory returns. His cryptic harangues usually
  make no sense, but at some point he
  mentions Project Eden. He can even give a
  clue to the location of Eden (Chapter 16).
  <br/><br/>* The stranger’s mind seems to clear up, he
  seems more lucid, when suddenly, he takes
  his own life. The event causes shock and
  anger in the Ark.
  <br/><br/><strong>Comment:</strong> The man is one of the cryo-frozen lab
  assistants from Project Eden. He may have escaped
  from Eden to find the Ark, or have been sent by
  Dr Retzius with a mission to report on the current
  status of the colonies. In any case, the cryo-sleep
  will have strained and ravaged his mind to the point
  where no amount of interrogation will make him
  reveal the truth about the Ark.
- |
  <h5>Missing Person</h5>
  An NPC disappears from the Ark without a trace. It
  might be someone close to a PC, a revered Chronicler
  or some other important person. Soon, the Ark
  is awash with rumors about what has happened. Has
  the missing person been killed? Have the Zone-
  Ghouls taken him away? Or – has he found Eden?
  <br/><br/>* It turns out the missing person had been in
  touch with another faction in the Zone prior
  to his disappearance. It could be another Ark,
  Wanderers (page 152) or even Zone-Ghouls.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss or someone close to the missing
  person wants to send an expedition to search
  for him.
  <br/><br/>* The expedition makes contact with another
  faction in the Zone.
- |
  <h5>Murder in the Ark</h5>
  A generally well-liked person in the Ark, or someone
  close to a PC, is found brutally murdered one morning.
  The body has been hacked to pieces. Nothing
  like this has ever happened in the Ark before.
  <br/><br/>* Soon, the killer is found, sitting catatonic and
  covered in blood in his den. He has only one
  excuse: The voices made me do it.
  <br/><br/>* It happens again. One mutant in a seemingly
  happy couple beats her partner to death, and
  then blames the “voices”. Paranoia grips the
  Ark.
  <br/><br/>* A PC is affected. Suddenly, he just knows
  a another PC must die, right now. He must
  immediately Fight, and won’t stop until he is
  broken or grappled down. Then, suddenly, the
  voices stop.
  <br/><br/>* The source of the murderous voices is a dying
  mutant, whose mind is falling apart. His
  psionic nightmares randomly affect innocent
  victims. When the People find out – how will
  they deal with him?
- |
  <h5>Mutant Messiah</h5>
  A minor Boss dreams strange dreams and begins
  to proclaim his visions of death and destruction to
  the People. Fatalistic hopelessness and the futility
  of all things are the core elements of this message,
  which attracts a growing number of followers.
  <br/><br/>* A friend of a PC joins the cult, and soon asks
  the PC to join too. The cult grows daily, causing
  concern among the other Bosses.
  <br/><br/>* The cultists begin refusing to take part in any
  of the projects in the Ark, instead spending
  their days performing bizarre rituals. The rest
  of the People suffer, and resentment towards
  the cult grows.
  <br/><br/>* Finally, things come to a head – the cult must
  be disbanded, leave the Ark or be destroyed.
  Maybe the PCs get caught in the middle.
- |
  <h5>The Mysterious Ruin</h5>
  A Stalker has seen a strange building in the Zone.
  Could there be grub or bullets there? A Boss
  wants to send out an expedition, and is looking
  for volunteers.
  <br/><br/>* If the PCs don’t volunteer, an NPC they have
  a relationship to asks them to come.
  <br/><br/>* A rival Boss tries to sabotage the expedition.
  He sends along a secret provocateur, who
  tries to make everything go wrong.
  <br/><br/>* If the PCs visit the strange building and
  return, some people in the Ark (possible the
  rival Boss above) publicly questions their
  story.
- |
  <h5>A New Kind of Beast</h5>
  Wandering in the Zone is always dangerous, but
  these last few days, even the most fearless Stalkers
  hardly dare leave the Ark. They say a new kind of
  beast is hunting out there. Not slow-witted monsters,
  but creatures with the intelligence of mutants
  and the ferocity of wild beasts.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss rallies a group of volunteers – preferably
  including some PCs – to go out and face
  this new threat. Another Boss thinks this is
  an unnecessary risk, and wants to stop the
  expedition.
  <br/><br/>* The hunting party finally leaves, and soon
  encounter the strange beasts. The risk of
  violence is high, but the beast mutants (page
  171) are ready to parley. Can mutants and
  animals get along?
  <br/><br/>* One mutant loses his cool, and rashly kills
  one of the animal mutants. The chance of
  peaceful coexistence vanishes quickly, and a
  violent showdown ensues.
- |
  <h5>The Other People</h5>
  They come walking out of the smog without warning.
  A group of mutants just like the People – but
  not as skinny and miserable. They say they come
  from a settlement out in the Zone, another Ark –
  and they want an alliance. They ask some of the
  People to come with them to their Ark, as guests.
  <br/><br/>* The visitors tell the People about the good
  life in their Ark. They say it’s ruled by the
  benevolent “Chairman”, and no mutant has to
  go hungry. The visit divides the People into
  two camps – one wants to visit the other Ark,
  the other wants the visitors dead or in chains.
  <br/><br/>* Finally, the People decide to send an expedition
  the other Ark. Try to get the PCs to join.
- |
  <h5>Project Sabotaged</h5>
  Under the cover of darkness, someone has sabotaged
  an important project in the Ark (Chapter 8).
  All of the hard work is lost, and needs to be redone
  from scratch. Everyone whispers about who did it
  and why, and the People start to regard each other
  with suspicion.
  <br/><br/>* A rumor spreads that the guilty person is an
  NPC (preferably a Chronicler or Gearhead)
  with a relationship to a PC.
  <br/><br/>* The suspected NPC comes to the PC for protection,
  to save himself from being lynched. A
  Boss wants him punished.
  <br/><br/>* The NPC reveals that he actually is the guilty
  party. He wants to stop all attempts to build
  a new society, to avoid another Apocalypse at
  any cost.
- |
  <h5>Revolution!</h5>
  Discontent is brewing among the People. The mutants
  hunger, while the Bosses have their fill. All
  it takes is a spark – an Enforcer strikes his Boss
  – and soon the entire Ark is set aflame as Slaves
  rise against their owners and take revenge for years
  of abuse.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss that a PC has a good relationship with
  is about to be lynched. Perhaps an NPC that
  a PC is close is part of the mob?
  <br/><br/>* A freed Slave proclaims himself “Leader of
  the People” and installs himself in the den
  of a dead Boss. He accuses one of the PCs of
  betraying the revolution.
  <br/><br/>* Several new Bosses appear, demanding that
  everyone in the Ark – including the PCs – say
  where their loyalties lie. In the end, the Ark is
  largely back to where it was before the revolt,
  only with new Bosses having replaced the old
  ones.
- |
  <h5>The Sinkhole</h5>
  In the dead of night, the Ark is shaken by a terrible
  rumble and tremor. When the dust settles, the People
  realize that nothing but a deep hole is left where
  some make-shift huts used to stand. The walls of
  the hole are steep and it is so deep you cannot see
  the bottom of it.
  <br/><br/>* A group of mutants (preferably including the
  PCs) climb down, and find themselves in an
  ancient hall with a caved in ceiling. Dark tunnels
  lead further into the deeps.
  <br/><br/>* In the tunnels, the explorers may find an old
  supply room, with thick layers of dust but
  also some useful artifacts.
  <br/><br/>* Further down, there is big mysterious
  machine
  that still seems to be active. The
  machine can activate robots (page 177) or the
  remains of a computerized defense system.
- |
  <h5>Starfall</h5>
  Suddenly, night turns into day. A light in the sky,
  stronger than any star, shoots across the night sky
  from east to west. The fireball disappears for an
  instant, darkness briefly falling over the Zone again.
  Then the horizon suddenly lights up in a massive
  but silent explosion.
  <br/><br/>* The starfall spreads fear in the Ark. A cult
  leader begins to preach that the People
  should all leave the Ark and travel to the
  place of impact. Among his followers is an
  NPC close to a PC.
  <br/><br/>* The cult is about to leave, but is stopped by
  force by another Boss who refuses to let the
  People split apart.
  <br/><br/>* An expedition is sent to the point of impact.
  There is nothing there, apart from
  Rot-contaminated debris of some strange vessel
  and a deadly robot (page 177) with orders
  to kill all mutants it comes across…
- |
  <h5>The Wanderers</h5>
  They come wandering through the Zone, a scrawny
  and grim-faced bunch in tattered old clothes. They
  speak in a strange and foreign accent, but manage
  to explain that they have wandered for several years
  from the mountains far away. They ask the People
  for grub and protection. None of the wanderers
  seem to have any mutations at all.
  <br/><br/>* It turns out that the wanderers intend to settle
  in the area for good – inside the Ark, or
  just outside of it. Some of the wanderers treat
  mutants as subordinate beings.
  <br/><br/>* Some Bosses grow increasingly hostile towards
  the wanderers, who start to act as if
  they owned the place. Arguments and fistfights
  break out.
  <br/><br/>* One fight ends with a wanderer getting killed
  by a mutant. The conflict risks escalating into
  open war, unless the two sides find a way to
  coexist peacefully. Whatever happens, the
  wanderers intend to settle in the Zone for
  good.
- |
  <h5>The Zone Cult</h5>
  There are rumors about a cult said to live in an
  ancient bunker out in the zonelands. Stalkers have
  seen men and women in long robes, strangely untouched
  by the filth and cold of the Zone. Who are
  they? Where do they come from? Do they have
  knowledge or artifacts that can benefit the People?
  <br/><br/>* An NPC close to a PC says that she has met
  one of the robed people near the Ark. She
  says they are magical beings, and wants help
  to visit them. She thinks she knows where
  their bunker is.
  <br/><br/>* A few robed cultists suddenly appear by the
  gate of the Ark. They are not talkative, and reveal
  nothing about themselves. They want to
  know if there are any unmutated humans in
  the Ark (such as the Wanderers, page 152, or
  the Man on the Beach, page 148). If so, they
  want to barter goods in exchange for these
  humans coming with them. If the People
  refuse, the cultists will attempt a kidnapping
  at some point.
  <br/><br/>* The People start to distrust the cultists and
  fear their mental powers, if these have been
  demonstrated. One Boss takes a cultist hostage,
  to trade for grub and artifacts. The situation
  could turn violent.
- |
  <h5>Zone Fever</h5>
  This deadly, bloody disease strikes suddenly and
  without mercy. From one day to the next mutants
  go from healthy to dying in a horrible fever, bleeding
  from all bodily cavities. The fever spreads like
  wildfire in the Ark. If nothing is done – quickly – the
  People will perish. But where is the cure?
  <br/><br/>* NPCs that the PCs care about are infected
  and die. The People are split into two camps
  – one that wants to try to treat the sick and another
  that just wants to quarantine them and
  let them die off.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss organizes an expedition to reach an
  old hospital in the Zone, where it is said healing
  drugs from the Old Age might still be
  stored.
  <br/><br/>* It turns out one of the first infected mutants
  has had contact with another faction in the
  Zone – other mutants, morlocks, the Nova
  Sect or the Wanderers (see Chapter 13).
  Could they have a cure?
- |
  <h5>Zone-Ghouls Attack</h5>
  They attack before dawn, without warning or mercy.
  They come from the deeps of the Zone, and enter
  the Ark while the People are sleeping. Then, the
  massacre begins. The Zone-Ghouls kill, burn and
  plunder with a feverish frenzy. Can the People stop
  them – or is this the end?
  <br/><br/>* One PC witnesses how an NPC he has a
  relationship to is surrounded by frenzied
  Zone-Ghouls.
  <br/><br/>* The Zone-Ghouls set fire to part of the Ark.
  The flames spread quickly.
  <br/><br/>* An NPC or a Boss tells a PC to flee with him.
  The Ark is lost and staying is suicide, he says.
- |
  <h5>The Zone Monster</h5>
  The People have had enough. There is a wild beast
  about that has torn mutants to pieces out in the
  Zone, and even started attacking people collecting
  scrap right outside the Ark’s walls. A Boss wants
  to lead a hunting expedition into the Zone to deal
  this threat once and for all.
  <br/><br/>* The expedition leaves to hunt the beast. PCs
  are asked to join.
  <br/><br/>* The beast can be a razorback (page 180), a
  devourer (page 178), or some other ferocious
  monster in Chapter 13. The hunting party
  finds the beast’s lair, riddled with remains of
  Zone-Ghouls and mutants.
  <br/><br/>* The hunting team confronts the beast in a
  fight to the death. An expedition from another
  Ark, or a group of Zone-Ghouls, can
  help or hinder.
- |
  <h5>The Zone Quakes</h5>
  It starts as a deep rumble from the very
  ground itself. Then the earth shakes, soon
  violently. Anyone not holding on to something
  is thrown to the ground. Then, as suddenly as it
  started, it’s over. For now.
  <br/><br/>* The quakes return, even stronger. The Ark is
  damaged by the tremors, perhaps destroying
  a project.
  <br/><br/>* A Boss (preferably a Cultist, page 100) proclaims
  that the quakes are a bad omen, a sign
  of the Ancients’ dissatisfaction with the People
  and a call for repentance.
  <br/><br/>* The PCs and other mutants might search for
  the cause of the tremors. It is detonations in
  a bunker deep underground, a war between
  rival security systems that were never turned
  off. If the PCs find the entrance they might
  meet robots (page 177).
