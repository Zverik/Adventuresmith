  encounters:
  - |
    The ground shakes and suddenly a ravenous landshark
    lunges up from the earth and attacks the PCs. The shark’s
    Strength is 7+{cmd_radioactive}
  - |
    A centipede snake contacts the PCs telepathically and asks
    for food. The snake can offer the PCs return the favor in
    some way. If they treat the snake badly, it attacks.
  - |
    A gnat storm suddenly envelops the PCs. The swarm’s
    Strength is 5+{cmd_radioactive}.
  - |
    A wildfire suddenly sweeps towards the PCs. If they try to
    Move away their roll is modified negatively by {cmd_radioactive} minus
    one (that is, no modification if you rolled one {cmd_radioactive} on the
    Threat Roll).
  - |
    A hungry winged moray lurks in a tree and attacks the PCs
    as they pass. They moray’s Strength is 5+{cmd_radioactive}
  - |
    The sounds of snapping branches and falling trees alert
    the PCs to the fact that something huge is coming their
    way. A giant hornbug rushes at them! The bug’s Strength
    is 9+{cmd_radioactive}.
  - |
    A foul stench spreads through the air and a powerful
    buzzing sound comes closer. A swarm of gas flies sweeps
    down towards the PCs. The swarm’s Strength is 4+{cmd_radioactive}.
  - |
    {cmd_radioactive} number of sniper bugs hide in the grass and attack the
    PCs without warning.
  - |
    The PCs meet a shambletusk (page 125) that has been
    expelled from its flock. It’s aggressive and might attack
    careless PCs.
  - |
    {cmd_radioactive} number of big and beautiful butterflies sit on a branch
    in front of the PCs. They are psionic butterflies, and the
    PCs should Move away if they know what’s good for
    them...
  - |
    The PCs encounter a hermit, a tainted animal mutant who
    has been cast out from his tribe. He is suspicious but can
    help the PCs if they treat him well.
  - |
    The PCs encounter an abomination. It might be an NPC the
    PCs know personally. The NPCs personality is wiped away
    and the abomination acts like a robot.
  - |
    The temperature suddenly plummets and a lethal ice storm
    surprises the PCs. It lasts D6+{cmd_radioactive} hours.
  - |
    A muffled rumble rises from within the very earth itself and
    grows into a powerful roaring crescendo. The earthquake
    attacks with 3+{cmd_radioactive}.
  - |
    A roar is heard from the mountain above the PCs, and
    they are horrified as an avalance thunders towards them!
    If they Move away their roll is modified negatively by {cmd_radioactive}.
  - |
    An unlucky PC falls down into a sinkhole. Any attempt to
    Move out of danger is modified negatively by {cmd_radioactive}.
  - |
    A geyser suddenly spews scaldingly hot water from within
    the bedrock.
  - |
    The PCs meet an animal mutant on the run from Watchers
    who want to abduct her. Preferably it is someone the PCs
    know. There are {cmd_radioactive} robots.
  - |
    The PCs meet a Scavenger from another tribe. The Scavenger
    has just found a valuable artifact (choose one randomly)
    and attempts to hide it from the PCs.
  - |
    The PCs meet D6+{cmd_radioactive} Hunters from another tribe who are
    out fishing. They have caught D6 rations of fish and are
    interested in trading.
  - |
    A small trade caravan walks by, heading towards a neighboring
    territory. The traders are suspicious of the PCs.
  - |
    The PCs find a hideout belonging to a trader from the closest
    outpost. The Scavenger appears while the PCs explore
    the hideout. He accuses them of theft.
  - |
    Strange song and exclamations are heard from a small
    hut. If the PCs hurry over to the hut they encounted a Seer
    in the midst of performing a ritual, and she resents being
    disturbed. The seer may have something important to tell
    the PCs.
  - |
    The PCs hear a scuffle and screaming in the distance. If
    they investigate they see two hunting parties from different
    territories in a fight over who controls the hunting grounds.
    Both sides ask the PCs for help.
  - |
    The PCs meet D6+{cmd_radioactive} Hunters from a tribe from a neighboring
    habitat, intruding in this one. The hunters are threatening
    and demand that the PCs leave “their” hunting ground.
  - |
    A Drone discovers the PCs and follows them for {cmd_radioactive} hours. If
    they act suspisciously - like trying to hide from the drone -
    it summons a squad of Sentinels.
  - |
    The road ahead is blocked by D6+{cmd_radioactive} Sentinels who have
    established a temporary roadblock. This roadblock works
    just like the permanent ones (page 150).
  - |
    A squad consisting of {cmd_radioactive} Sentinels drags away an unconscious
    animal mutant, who is about to be abducted. Preferably
    it is someone the PCs have a relationship with. If the
    Sentinels are attacked they summon reinforcements.
  - |
    A robotic voice requests that the PCs leave the area immediately.
    If they do not comply a Drone and {cmd_radioactive} Sentinels
    arrive to force them to leave or to kill them.
  - |
    A squad of {cmd_radioactive}+1 Sentinels approaches. If the robots spot
    the PCs they request they leave the area immediately. If the
    PCs act suspisciously the Sentinels attack.
  - |
    A Walker blocks the road. It seems to be inactive, but if the
    PCs come close it activates and attacks at once.
