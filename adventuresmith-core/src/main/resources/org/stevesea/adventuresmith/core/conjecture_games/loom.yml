    vals:
    - <strong>Foreshadowing</strong> – set a thread to be the main thread for the next scene. The current scene should then start wrapping up and heading towards the next scene.
    - <strong>Tying Off</strong> – the main thread resolves or substantially moves forward in this scene by narrative decree. This does not mean that the main thread cannot create follow-up threads.
    - <strong>To Conflict</strong> – the next scene centers on a conflict of your choosing. Set the main elements of the next scene, and start heading toward them in this scene.
    - <strong>Costume Change</strong> – an NPC drastically changes their mind, motivations, alliances, etc. for better or worse. This could be a big story reveal or a simple change of heart.
    - <strong>Key Grip</strong> – set the location or general elements for the next scene. The current scene should then start wrapping up and heading towards the next scene.
    - <strong>To Knowledge</strong> – the next scene centers on lore or investigation of your choosing. Set the main elements of the next scene, and start heading toward them in this scene.
    - <strong>Framing</strong> – an NPC (new or pre-existing) or object becomes critical to the main thread.
    - <strong>Set Change</strong> – scene continues in another location. The current thread remains as much as makes sense.
    - <strong>Upstaged</strong> – an NPC makes a big move. If the NPC has any motivations, plot vectors, or goals they go into overdrive.
    - <strong>Pattern Change</strong> – the main thread gets modified, drastically. Whatever direction the main thread was heading, make a hard left. Use a generator, such as Rory’s Story Cubes, tarot cards or a random Wikipedia page, as necessary.
    - <strong>Limelit</strong> – the rest of the scene goes great for the PC’s. Assume that the majority of the questions pertaining to the main thread with regard to the scene are answered in a way that benefits the PC’s.
    - <strong>Entering the Red</strong> – threat of danger or combat arrives. The premise of the scene gets more dangerous in a way that forces the PC’s to respond by leaving, fighting, or taking their chances.
    - <strong>To Endings</strong> – the next scene resolves or substantially moves forward a thread of your choosing. Set the main elements of the next scene, and start heading toward them in this scene.
    - <strong>Montage</strong> – the timeframe of the scene changes to a montage of actions set across various scenes to move forward.
    - <strong>Enter Stage Left</strong> – a PC or NPC (new or pre-existing) arrives fresh in the scene.
    - <strong>Cross-stitch</strong> - choose another thread to be the main thread for the rest of the scene.
    - <strong>Six Degrees</strong> – a meaningful, but not always positive, connection forms between two PC’s and/or NPC’s.
