      1, Amnesiac</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -2
      <br/><br/>
      A human woman staggers through the Zone. Her
      eyes are glazed over and seem to focus on some
      imagined horror. She mumbles alien words, barely
      audible. She wears dirty and torn coveralls with
      strange markings. She doesn’t respond to the PCs
      and collapses on the ground if they try to stop her.
      Unless Healed, she dies in a couple of hours. If she
      survives the PCs can talk to her, but her dialect is
      foreign and she seems to have lost all memory of
      who she is and where she came from. She might
      have a clue to the location of Eden (Chapter 16).
      <br/><br/>If you have played the Threat Card called The
      Man on the Beach (page 148), the PCs can recognize
      both the clothing and the dialect – the woman
      has the same. She also reacts in a similar way if
      brought to the Ark. Just like the man on the beach,
      the woman is one of the cryo-frozen lab assistants
      from Project Eden – see Chapter 16.

      2-3, Beast Mutants</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      Out in the Zone, there is a tribe of beings that are
      different from all others. They are not human mutants
      and they are not wild beasts – they are both.
      They are animals, but they walk upright on their
      hind legs, use tools and have a spoken language –
      primitive and coarse, but a language nonetheless.
      They are newcomers to the Zone, on their guard or
      even hostile to strangers. Despite their few numbers
      the beast mutants seem to belong to several different
      species – some look like ragged dogs or wolves,
      others are short and rodent-like, and a third variety
      are monkey-like climbers.
      <br/><br/>The truth is that the beast mutants – like the
      People themselves – can trace their origin to the
      genetics labs of the Ancients, bred to be able to
      survive the harsh world after the Apocalypse. They
      are animals given parts of the human intellect and
      fine motor skills. The small tribe that recently arrived
      in the Zone has fled from an old research facility
      located in a distant mountain range, where
      many of their kin still are being held captive by the
      mysterious Watchers. The escapees have journeyed
      to the area of the Zone to find a new home.
    - |
      4-6, Cannibals</h5>
      A group of wiry mutants wearing rags and white
      face paint. These mutants come from an Ark
      where the scientists died early on (see Chapter
      16), and the abandoned children developed a very
      brutal society. They are sly and bloodthirsty, and
      they hunger for fresh mutant meat. They can’t
      easily be reasoned with (modification -3 to any
      Manipulation attempt, and even a successful roll
      will only buy the PCs time until the cannibals get
      hungry again). Only a very clear show of force
      will deter the cannibals. Any fallen mutants in
      their own ranks will soon become grub for the
      survivors.
    - |
      7-8, Doom Cultists</h5>
      A small band of mutants, expelled from their Ark
      years ago, who worship a particular ruin or artifact
      in the Zone. They have lost all common sense and
      live only to worship the object, which they think
      will bring the Ancients back to Earth. The cultists
      may try to recruit PCs and NPCs, or capture them
      to sacrifice them to their deity. The cult may be in
      possession of a clue to Eden (Chapter 16).
    - |
      9-11, Exiled Mutants</h5>
      A dozen mutants in a sorry state. Their clothes
      are in tatters, some are limping, others have untreated
      and infected wounds. They are all starving
      and badly contaminated by the Rot. Some might
      even be infected by Parasite Fungus (page 180)
      or the Gutfish (page 179). These mutants come
      from another Ark, but have been exiled for some
      reason. They beg the PCs for help, but they also
      take the first chance they get to attack and steal
      the PCs grub – or worse. If the PCs are friendly,
      the exiles can tell them about their Ark – and they
      might even have a clue about the location of Eden
      (Chapter 16).
    - |
      12-14, Expedition from another Ark</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      An expedition, not unlike the PCs’ own, but from
      another Ark. The strangers are about as many as
      the PCs. If they haven’t met mutants from another
      Ark before (through the Threat Card called “The
      Other People”, see page 150), this meeting can be
      a turning point in the history of both peoples. The
      expedition may have an artifact with a clue leading
      to the location of Eden (Chapter 16).
    - |
      15-17, Helldrivers</h5>
      Thunder as from an approaching storm rolls
      across the zonelands. Soon, a horde of bizarre vehicles
      comes rolling. Cars, buses, motorcycles and
      trucks – all adorned with sharp spikes, skulls and
      scrap. The feared Helldrivers are mutants who left
      their Ark long ago and were lucky enough to come
      across a big garage with operational vehicles from
      the Old Age.
    - |
      18-20, Morlocks</h5>
      Some degenerate wild mutants from lost Arks have
      taken refuge underground, in tunnels and shelters.
      These are called morlocks. During the years, the
      morlocks have lost what little civilization they
      started with. Now, they are little more than savages
      and communicate with grunts and snarls. They are
      not hostile to strangers, but on their guard. If given
      something in return, they can provide help or information.
      <br/><br/>If attacked, they defend themselves with
      animal ferocity. They may be in possession of an
      artifact that gives a clue to the location of Eden
      (Chapter 16).
    - |
      21-22, Nova Cultists</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      A procession of men and women with shaved heads,
      dressed in long robes. They leave some cloth bundles
      on the ground and leave quietly. If the PCs
      investigate, they find that each bundle contains
      a small mutant baby. They are hypothermic and
      weak, and will die unless the PCs Heal them. Any
      surviving children will develop powerful mental
      mutations.
      <br/><br/>The robed people belong to the mythical Nova
      Cult (page 152). If the PCs confront the cultists, they
      treat them like air or are spoken to like children. If
      the PCs resort to violence, the cultists won’t hesitate
      to use their mental mutations. If the PCs are
      careful, they can track the cultists back to their lair
      (page 212).
    - |
      23-24, Patrol from the Ark</h5>
      This patrol from the PCs’ own Ark has found a
      valuable artifact, or they say they know where to
      find one. The leader either wants help to bring the
      artifact back to the Ark, or help to retrieve it. One
      of the members of the patrol can very well be an
      NPC that a PC has a relationship to.
    - |
      25-26, Scrap Oracle</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      A short and stocky mutant, dressed in a bizarre outfit
      made of scrap of all shapes and sizes. He’s an
      oddball character with powerful mental mutations,
      a telepath that can see visions of the PCs’ possible
      future. His powers can help the PCs interpret a clue
      to Eden or guide them in some other way. You can
      use the scrap oracle to nudge the PCs in some direction
      that you’d like the campaign to go.
    - |
      27-28, Wanderers</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      A scrawny and grim-faced band of humans in tattered
      clothes with a strange look come walking
      through the zonelands. They are on their guard
      but not hostile. If the PCs show that they mean no
      harm, the wanderers can tell – in a strange and foreign
      dialect – that they have walked for years from
      a mountain range far away. They ask for grub and
      water. They want to know where the PCs’ settlement
      is, and may get hostile if they refuse to answer.
      <br/><br/>
      See the Ark threat called “The Wanderers”
      (page 152) for more information on what might happen
      if the wanderers come to the Ark. If you have
      already used this Ark threat, this can be a splinter
      group that has left the main community after some
      internal strife. Finally, the wanderers might have a
      clue to Eden (Chapter 16).
    - |
      29-30, Water Trader</h5>
      A lonesome traveler who defies the dangers of the
      zonelands to trade with clean water. He’s a tall mutant
      pulling a simple cart, followed by two scrawny
      mutts. On the cart there are old plastic bottles, big
      jerrycans and a strange contraption built of pipes
      and bottles (a Jury-Rigged purification set). The
      water trader is friendly sort and always ready to do
      business – and quite ready to defend himself if he
      needs to. He knows much about the Zone and can
      tell the PCs where other settlements are located. He
      may also have a clue to Eden, which he could trade
      for. He will ask where the PCs live and will try to
      get to the Ark to do business.
    - |
      31-32, Wreckers</h5>
      A surprisingly intact big old vehicle wreck sits in a
      clearing in the Zone. Its windows are dirty and its
      hatches locked. The wreck is a trap. A band of savage
      mutants or Zone-Ghouls uses it as bait for unwitting
      Zone travelers. Their typical plan is simple:
      <br/>
      They charge out and try attack their victims before
      they see what’s coming. They will steal everything
      and take any survivors as slaves in their tribe. The
      wreckers haven’t been able to open the armored car
      themselves. If the PCs manage to get in, they will find
      an artifact. The car engine is decayed beyond repair.
    - |
      33-36, Zone-Ghouls</h5>
      When Stalkers tell harrowing stories by the trashcan
      fires in the Ark, they are most often about the
      Zone-Ghouls. These aggressive people live like
      nomads in the Zone, moving in the shadows and
      attacking other travelers without warning. They are
      most active at night. There are many rumors about
      the Zone-Ghouls – it is said that they flay and eat
      mutants taken captive.
      <br/><br/>Zone-Ghouls are generally shorter than mutants,
      and they move in large groups. They hide
      their faces in hoods or masks made of scrap from
      the Old Age, and often wear scavenged plastic
      cloaks to protect them against sunlight and acid
      rains. Their hands and feet are wrapped in plastic
      or cloth.

      1-2, Acid Grass</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      A field of tall grass. A sharp smell hangs in the air,
      and in the undergrowth remains of dead animals
      can be seen. The grass moves back and forth as if
      in a wind – despite the air being dead calm here.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The grassy field is actually a predatory plant. If
      any animal or mutant walk in to the grass, it will
      start to entangle itself into the victim’s feet, legs
      and gear. Then, the grass starts to excrete a potent
      acid, slowly melting the target into a stinking
      sludge that the grass can feed on.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> A PC who actively and successfully Scouts the area
      will notice the old bones in the grass. Anyone moving into the
      field is immediately attacked by six Base Dice. On a hit, the
      victim is snared and suffers one point of damage from the
      acid. To get free, the victim needs to make a Force roll (others
      can help, page 48). Until then, he suffers another point of
      damage every turn.
      <br/>
      The grass can only be damaged by fire. Count its total
      Strength as 10. When it reaches zero, the grass is dead and
      the area can be passed without risk.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      3, Air Jellies</h5>
      Air Jellies are strange creatures, translucent fleshy
      bubbles the size of an open palm. Thin, long feelers
      hang down from the main body. They are lighter
      than air and hover, blowing wherever the wind takes
      them. Anything that the feelers come into contact
      with is covered by a sticky, acidic liquid – not harmful
      to human skin, but corrosive to metal.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Air Jellies don’t attack mutants themselves, but rather
      their gear. Roll to attack using six Base Dice (the Strength
      score of the swarm). Every |radioactive-symbol| decreases the Gear Bonus of
      the target item by one step. The attacks continue until the Air
      Jellies are destroyed or the victims manage to escape.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swarm:</strong> Air Jellies can only be hurt by fire or
      explosions.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      4, Automaton</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -2
      <br/><br/>
      In the dark depths of the enclaves (Chapter 16), the
      Titan Powers built machines of metal, plastic and
      circuits, so advanced that they could compete with
      their own creators in intelligence, adaptability and
      creativity. Some researchers even experimented in
      melting together man and machine, in the hope of
      creating a being more adapted to surviving in the
      postapocalyptic world.
      <br/><br/>Robots and biomechatronic beings, in many
      shapes and sizes, will be explored in a future expansion
      to Mutant: Year Zero. But already in the
      base game, PCs can run into a rare automaton that
      for some reason has found its way to the Zone. For
      the People, such a being will be seen as a horrible
      abomination, a walking or hovering metal being
      with weapons mounted in its very body.
      <br/><br/><strong>Special:</strong> The Automaton cannot suffer fatigue at
      all. Its Agility score never decreases.
    - |
      5-6, Bitterbeasts</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      Dangerous creatures that Stalkers call Bitterbeasts
      often prowl the Zone close to lakes and swamps.
      These are giant lizards, twice the size of a normal
      mutant. Bitterbeasts are fairly intelligent and it is
      even said they can be tamed and used as mounts.
      <br/><br/>That’s not without risk however. The Bitterbeasts
      are known for their foul temper and the ability that
      has given them their name – they spit acid with
      alarming accuracy.
    - |
      7-8, Deathworm</h5>
      A mutated abomination that hunts by burrowing
      through the ground and waiting for an unwitting
      victim to pass by. The Deathworm is twice the
      length of a mutant and thick as a leg. It’s covered
      in scales, has innumerable small legs and a big gaping
      maw with several rings of small but very sharp
      teeth. The beast is very tenacious and will keep
      attacking until its victim or it is dead. It lacks the
      intelligence to flee.
    - |
      9-10, Devourer</h5>
      A large and savage predator, taller than a mutant
      when it stands on its hind legs. It has grey fur and
      looks a little like a bear, but the similarities end
      there. The Devourer has an insatiable hunger for
      flesh, can move with extreme silence, and has abnormally
      huge jaws. It sneaks up on its prey, who
      often doesn’t realize what’s going on before it’s halfway
      down the gullet of the beast. The jaws can be
      dislocated to fit the whole upper body of a grown
      mutant. Corrosive saliva quickly kills the prey, who
      won’t be released until it’s dead or the Devourer is
      forced to flee.
    - |
      11-12, Grazers</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      Here and there in the Zone, herds of relatively
      peaceful grazing animals roam. These are mutated
      versions of sheep, goats, pigs and cows. They have
      gone feral and won’t hesitate to attack Zone travelers
      that they see as threat to the herd. Grazers are
      good targets for hunting (see the Butcher talent in
      Chapter 4).
    - |
      13, Gutfish (infected water)</h5>
      The Gutfish is a feared parasite that spreads
      through drinking water. Even Rot-free water can
      be infected – the only way to be safe is to boil the
      water. The Gutfish spawn grow inside the stomach
      of the host, feeding off whatever the host eats.
      When the Gutfish, which looks more like an eel
      than a fish, is fully grown (approximately six feet
      long) it bites its way out and slithers away to the
      nearest lake or creek.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> After the infection, the host gets incredibly hungry and
      must eat at least two rations of grub per day not to become
      starving (page 92). After 2D6 days, the Gutfish is fully grown
      and tries to gnaw its way out. This will automatically break
      the host (Strength drops to zero) and suffers the Bleeding Gut
      critical injury (entry 52 on the table on page 91).
      </blockquote>
    - |
      14, Killer Tree</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      An overgrown area that is unnervingly still and
      quiet. This is the home of one of the most feared
      and bizarre beings in the entire Zone – the Killer
      Tree. Its thick, dark trunk ends in a gaping maw,
      that is surrounded by slithering tentacles. Among
      the tree’s thick and gnarled roots lie bones, skulls
      and rusty gear – remains of the Killer Tree’s many
      victims.
      <br/><br/>The most astonishing parts of this semi-sentient
      plant are its humanoid seed pods. They can mimic
      human (or mutant) appearance and even speech,
      but lack actual intelligence. The seed pods prowl
      the area, hunting for victims to feed their ever hungry
      mother tree.
      <br/><br/><strong>Mind Control:</strong> The Killer Tree can lure its victims
      close with powerful telepathic pulses. Anyone
      within Short range must roll to Move – a failed roll
      means the victim suffers one point of confusion
      and must move closer to the tree.
      <br/><br/><strong>Seed Pods:</strong> Victims who manage to withstand the
      tree’s mind powers are usually attacked by its humanoid
      seed pods. In their natural state, the pods
      have greenish hue and lack both body hair and
      any distinct facial features. A typical seed pod has
      Strength 3, Agility 5 and Fight skill level 2.
      <br/><br/>A seed pod can mimic the exact appearance of a
      human or mutant, by pushing tendrils into the brain
      of the victim and extracting its stem cells. The victim,
      who needs to be held down or broken by damage
      for the attack to be made, dies in the process. A
      seed pod becomes totally identical to its victim and
      can even mimic its voice, but is completely without
      emotion and cannot be Manipulated or Intimidated.
    - |
      15, Mind Mosquitoes</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      In the Zone, there are areas buzzing with mosquitoes
      that can have direct impact on the human
      (or mutant) mind. Anyone moving in the
      area starts to feel depressed and despondent.
      <br/><br/>The victims feel a growing urge to just sit down
      and do nothing at all, which lets the mosquitoes
      suck blood unhindered. The attack in itself is not
      harmful, but the mental effects can have dangerous
      consequences.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Victims affected by the Mind Mosquitoes each turn
      suffer an attack with a number of Base Dice equal to the
      Strength of the swarm – a typical starting value is 8. Each |radioactive-symbol|
      rolled inflicts one point of doubt. To get away, a victim needs
      to make a Move roll. The swarm can only be hurt by fire or
      explosions. When its Strength reaches zero, it is completely
      destroyed.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      16, Nightmare Flowers</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      An area filled with large flowers, clinging to every
      surface. Heavy and moist petals, stamens and pistils
      grow with intense colors. If anyone moves through
      the area, the flowers will exude a cloud of spores
      with a strong sedative effect. When a victim falls
      unconscious to the ground, the plants’ thorny vines
      burrow into its flesh and suck the blood out of them.
      Remains of previous victims litter the ground, but
      can be hard to spot beneath the greenery. There
      might even be an artifact here.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> A PC who Scouts the area successfully will notice
      the bones of previous victims. Anyone who walks into the
      greenery must make a Move roll or be incapacitated by the
      powerful spores. Lying on the ground, the victim suffers one
      point of damage per turn until he is broken or until someone
      pulls him out (a Force roll). The Nightmare Flowers can only
      be destroyed by fire. Count the flowers’ combined Strength
      as 10. When it reaches zero, the flowers are dead and the
      area can be passed without risk
      </blockquote>
    - |
      17, Parasite Fungus</h5>
      This deadly fungoid life form infects its victims
      through mycelium at close contact with an infected
      body. The Parasite Fungus grows inside the host’s
      body and brain, with horrible pain as a result. The
      victim’s behavior is also affected.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> After the time of infection, the victim suffers one point
      of damage per day. This damage can be healed by rest and
      grub, but this will mean the victim needs to eat more to keep
      from being broken. If broken, the victim suffers a critical
      injury from non-typical damage (page 92).
      <br/><br/>At irregular intervals (whenever you want) the Parasite
      Fungus affects the victim’s brain in order to make it come
      close to another host, to keep spreading the infection. The
      victim needs to make a Wits roll (no skill can be used) to
      resist the impulse. The only way to be cured is to be broken
      by damage and then Healed.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      18, Razorback</h5>
      A huge monster of a boar, standing taller than a
      mutant and angrier than a dozen. Despite its rather
      small legs, this beast can achieve an astonishing
      speed, and its rugged tusks can tear a car wreck
      apart. Anything seems to set the Razorback off on
      a killing frenzy, and stopping it is nigh impossible.
      <br/><br/>The beast is not a predator and generally does not
      hunt to feed – instead in feeds on anything from
      corpses to Zone plants.
    - |
      19-20, Rot Ants</h5>
      The Rot Ants are a legend among Zone travelers.
      The worst thing is not the insect as such – nasty as it
      is, the size of a fist and with powerful jaws – but the
      overwhelming numbers. Rot Ants don’t build anthills.
      Instead, they barrage through the Zone in millions
      upon millions, devouring everything in their path.
      <br/><br/>They are blind and consider any living thing as food.
      Stalkers claim to have seen a swarm of Zone Ants
      kill a Devourer in under a minute. As if that was not
      enough, these insect spread the Rot wherever they go.
      <br/><br/><strong>Rot:</strong> Any attack from Rot Ants, whether successful
      or not, inflicts one point for Rot on the victim.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swarm:</strong> The Rot Ants’ swarm is huge. It simply
      cannot be decimated by any weapons the PCs could
      conceivably get their hands on. The only way to
      survive is to run.

      21, Rotfish</h5>
      In the murky waters of Zone lakes and rivers, the
      Rotfish lurk. This monster varies greatly in shape,
      from scaly flatfish to eel-like beasts with sharp fins.
      <br/><br/>The Rotfish can attack swimmers or careless Zone
      travelers walking close to the waterline, and often
      pulls its prey down under water to drown it.
      <br/><br/>Drowning: In the turn after a successful Fight attack,
      the Rotfish can pull its prey down under water
      to drown it. The victim will suffer one point of damage
      per turn (unless Amphibian) and must make a
      Force roll to break free.
    - |
      22-23, Scrap Crows</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      Big, ash-feathered birds that live in flocks in the
      Zone. They can attack Zone travelers careless
      enough to walk out in the open, hacking at the
      eyes with their sharp beaks. These Rot-ridden birds
      are called Scrap Crows by the People because they
      are attracted by anything shiny especially valuable
      scrap from the Old Age.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swarm:</strong> Can only be harmed by fire or explosions.
    - |
      24, Trash Hawk</h5>
      Perched on the roofs of tall ruins, the Trash Hawk
      watches the Zone for prey. Yellow and brown feathers
      make it blend in well in the wasteland. This
      predatory bird has claws long and sharp as knives,
      and attack by quickly swooping down at its target
      and simply ripping off a large piece of flesh. If big
      enough, it even grabs its prey and flies off with it.
      Stalkers claim to have seen Trash Hawks with a
      wingspan of 25 feet.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swooping Attack:</strong> A Trash Hawk can swoop down
      from Long distance and Fight its target immediately.
      The bird takes one point of damage itself in
      the attack.
      <br/><br/><strong>Lift Off:</strong> In the turn after a successful attack, the
      Trash Hawk can fly off with its prey if it makes a
      Force roll.
    - |
      25, Worm Swarm</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      This enormous cluster of black worms, each a few
      inches long, has developed a collective mind and
      behaves like an individual being. A typical Worm
      Swarm consists of millions of maggots. These bizarre
      beings often dwell in dark and damp places,
      attacking prey that happen to pass by. The swarm
      moves rapidly to engulf the victim and cause it to
      panic, and then proceeds to eat it alive.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swarm:</strong> The Worm Swarm counts as a swarm and
      can only be damaged by fire and explosions.
    - |
      26-28, Zone Dogs</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      Packs of ever hungry mutated mutts are common
      in the Zone. They are scrawny, wiry and often
      lack fur.
    - |
      29-30, Zone Leeches</h5>
      Fist-sized critters that dwell in thick undergrowth
      or in dark ruins, sensing the heat of passing prey
      and falling onto it. These slimy beasts have neither
      legs nor eyes, only a maw ringed by small and
      sharp teeth. If a leech lands on a living being, it
      immediately bites into the flesh and starts sucking
      blood out at an alarming rate. A dozen leeches can
      completely drain a grown mutant.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swarm:</strong> Zone Leeches can only be hurt by fire or
      explosions.
    - |
      31-33, Zone Rats</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      These scrawny but unnervingly large rats live in
      hordes in the Zone. The Rot just seems to make
      them bigger and meaner. They are long as a
      mutant’s arm and will chew into any meat they
      come across, alive or dead, with their long, yellow
      teeth.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swarm:</strong> Can only be damaged by fire or explosions.
      <br/><br/><strong>Rot:</strong> Every attack from a Zone Rat, whether successful
      or not, inflicts a Rot Point on the target.
    - |
      34-35, Zone Spider</h5>
      In dark tunnels and ruins, mutated spiders grown
      to absurd sizes dwell. Careless Zone travelers who
      step right through old decayed tunnel roofs or who
      explore ancient ruins can end up right in the middle
      of a nest. The Zone Spiders feed on anything
      from corpses and refuse to living prey that they first
      paralyze with their poisonous bite
      <br/><br/>Poison: If the spider’s bite inflicts damage, the
      poison enters the victim’s body and causes one
      point of fatigue per turn until the victim is broken.
      A successful Heal roll (modification −2 if attempting
      it on oneself) to suck the poison out will stop
      the process.
    - |
      36-37, Zone Wasps</h5>
      The first thing the victims hear is the buzzing
      sound, unnaturally deep and repulsive. The Zone
      Wasps are black and yellow like their ancestors in
      the Old Age, but big as fists and just as hard. Their
      sting injects a potent hallucinogenic poison that
      confuses the prey and makes it easier for the insects
      to tear it apart. As if that was not bad enough,
      in combat the Zone Wasps emit pheromones that
      alert other Zone Wasps nearby, quickly swelling
      their numbers.
      <br/><br/><strong>Hallucinogenic Poison:</strong> All attacks that give the
      victim one or more points of damage also inflicts
      one point of confusion.
      <br/><br/><strong>Pheromones:</strong> The Strength of the swarm increases
      one step every turn until the victims are either dead
      or have escaped.
      <br/><br/><strong>Swarm:</strong> The Zone Wasps can only be damaged by
      fire or explosions.
    phenomenon:
    - |
      1-3, Acid Rain</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      Heavy raindrops start to fall from the Zone sky. But
      this is no ordinary rain. The strongly acidic drops
      burn whatever they land on, and the PCs need to seek
      cover. When the Acid Rain is over (after D6 hours),
      everything in the area is pockmarked by the acid
      drops, and puddles of burning acid cover the ground.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Anyone caught in the Acid Rain suffers an attack with
      a number of Base Dice determined by the intensity of the rain
      – 6 is normal, but anything from 4 to 10 is possible. Every /
      rolled inflicts one point of damage. Armor works normally.
      The victims suffer one attack like this per turn until they manage
      to find a shelter that protects them from the rain – this
      normally requires a Move roll.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      4-5, Ash Storm</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      A strong gale sweeps across the Zone, whipping up
      the ashes that lie in droves among the ruins. The
      ash cloud reduces visibility to a few feet, stings the
      eyes and makes it hard to breathe. After a few hours,
      when the air finally clears, everything is covered in
      a fine layer of ash.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Zone travelers who want to push on in the Ash Storm
      need to make an Endure roll. A failed roll means the travelers
      must stop and find shelter. The storm lasts D6 hours.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      6-7, Dust Tornado</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      The wind suddenly picks up and the air is filled
      by sand and ashes. Around the PCs, black twirling
      funnels of tornados appear. Suddenly, and old
      house is pulled apart by a black twister, moving
      right toward the PCs.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Anyone in the path of the Dust Tornado needs to make
      a Move roll to get away in time. Failure results in an attack
      with 12 Base Dice (weapon damage 1). Cover and armor
      have their normal effect.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      8-9, Electric Storm</h5>
      Dark clouds descend on the area. The air smells
      like metal, hairs stand straight up and all metal
      objects start to spark. Suddenly, lightning starts
      to strike everywhere. Again and again, the area is
      bombarded. The flashes of light are blinding and
      the thunder deafening. The Electric Storm only lasts
      a few minutes, but they feel like a lifetime.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Anyone caught in the storm is subject to an attack with
      four Base Dice (weapon damage 1). A victim located on high
      ground or on something made of metal suffers an attack with
      eight Base Dice. Cover helps, but armor does not. Roll again
      in every turn until the PCs have found cover – which requires
      a successful Move roll.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      10, Ghost Lights</h5>
      A pale green shimmering light moves among the
      ruins or trees in the area. If anyone tries to get close
      to the light, it moves away, as if aware of their presence.
      The strange light remains in the area for some
      minutes, then suddenly disappears.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> None – but feel free to let the players think otherwise.
      The PCs cannot affect the Ghost Lights in any way.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      11, Inertia Field</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      Some distance away, the PCs spot a monster or a
      humanoid who seems completely frozen in the middle
      of a motion. If anyone moves closer, others see
      how this person seems to move in slow motion. In
      this area, there is a strange force field that makes
      time itself slow down. To anyone moving into the
      field, the outside world seems to move more quickly.
      <br/><br/>The effect increases further into the field. It is possible
      to talk to someone inside of the field, but to
      him the voices will speak very quickly and be very
      shrill. His own voice will be slow to persons outside
      of the field.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Being at the outer rim of the field is not dangerous,
      but anyone moving toward its center risks being caught in
      it forever. Let a PC who moves into the field (or who seems
      someone else caught in it) roll to Know the Zone. If successful,
      the PC realizes the risk.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      12-13, Magnetic Field</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      The remains of some sort of ancient underground
      power plant creates a strong magnetic field in this
      area. The PCs hear a low humming sound and get
      goosebumps on their skin. If they linger in the area,
      they will feel metal objects being pulled toward a
      particular point.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> The PCs must either drop all metal objects that they
      are carrying, or make a Force roll to get out of the Magnetic
      Field with their metal gear. Anyone wearing scrap
      armor must make a Force roll, it’s not possible to get out
      of the armor fast enough. Anyone who fails the roll can
      try again in the next turn, but with a −1 modification. The
      modification grows to −2 in the third turn, etc. Suddenly
      and inexplicably (whenever you decide), the Magnetic Field
      dissipates.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      14, Mirage</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      The terrain close to the PCs suddenly blurs and
      deforms. It changes appearance completely and
      now looks like it did in the Old Age – no decay,
      no debris, everything clean and orderly. The PCs
      have walked into a hologram, the remains of ancient
      defensive perimeter.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> The PCs risk bumping into things that they cannot see,
      and therefore must act as if in total darkness (page 93). The
      hologram is approximately 50 feet across.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      15-16, Mud Puddles</h5>
      This foggy area is covered by large puddles of
      thick, warm mud. There is solid ground underneath
      the mud, but it will reach to the knees of
      anyone who walks through the puddles. In addition,
      there are hidden wells of steaming hot water
      in some places. Walking through the area risks
      triggering geysers of hot water, scalding everyone
      nearby.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> A PC who successfully Scouts the area will notice
      bubbles and steam coming out of the mud at certain locations.
      Wading through the area requires a Know the Zone
      roll – failure means triggering a steam geyser. Roll six Base
      Dice to attack everyone within Near distance. Every |radioactive-symbol| rolled
      inflicts one point of damage. Armor has the normal effect.
      <br/><br/>Anyone who suffers one or more points of damage also gets
      one Rot Point. Staying in this area has one useful effect – the
      hot steam keeps the area warm, and thus protects against
      severe cold (page 93).
      </blockquote>
    - |
      17-18, Night Lights</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      Huge, billowing lights in sickly colors fill the night
      sky. Artifacts and other gear that run on electricity
      start to work erratically, or not at all. Some see a
      bad omen in these lights, others the sign of a new
      dawn for the world. Some just find the lights pretty.
      <br/><br/>The lights last until morning.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong>All electric artifacts (such as the Flashlight, Cassette
      Player, and Video Camera) won’t work properly as long as
      the Night Lights linger.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      19, Obelisk</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      In the middle of wasteland, the tall black Obelisk
      stands. It seems to be made of some kind of very
      durable metal. The PCs cannot find any visible
      hatches or slits in the metal, and the Obelisk seems
      to be completely untouched by the passage of time.
      <br/><br/>The Obelisk seems alien to the PCs, and it can even
      affect their minds in strange ways.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> The energies emanating from The Obelisk can induce
      psychedelic hallucinations. Anyone within Short range of it
      must make a Know the Zone roll – failure means suffering a
      point of confusion.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      20-21, Pillars of Light</h5>
      Two big pillars of light appear by the horizon,
      beaming up toward the black Zone sky. Where
      do the lights originate? And why have they appeared
      now?
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> None. But have NPCs tell tales of these lights, saying
      that the lead the way to Eden, to another Ark, or that they
      are a bad omen.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      22-24, Rot Hotspot</h5>
      The coast seems clear. There are no visible threats
      around, and the exploration can commence unhindered.
      <br/><br/>But in this place, the Rot is very strong
      and can kill unwitting Zone travelers or scar them
      for life.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Give the players a chance to notice that something
      is amiss, such as a number of cadavers on the ground or a
      pipe leaking green sludge. Anyone who proceeds despite the
      warning signs suffers one Rot Point per minute in the area.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      25-26, Rot Wind</h5>
      A wind carrying foul Rot-ridden fumes sweep across
      the sector. The air is filled by dust and a sickening
      stench.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> The Rot Wind immediately inflicts one Rot Points on
      every person caught in it. In addition, any water or grub carried
      by the PCs will be contaminated by Rot, inflicting one Rot
      Point per ration consumed. The Rot Wind lasts D6 hours.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      27-28, Sinkhole</h5>
      The ground suddenly gives in, and a huge hole into
      the ground or into some ancient underground facility
      opens up.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Anyone close to the collapse must make a Move roll to
      avoid falling into the Sinkhole. Doing so inflicts one point of
      damage in itself – and can expose the victim to any number
      of underground threats, such as monsters or Rot. Climbing up
      can also be difficult, usually requiring a Move roll.
      </blockquote>
    - |
      29-30, Temperature Drop / Heat Wave</h5>
      Pick whichever is appropriate for the current season.
      <h6>Temperature Drop</h6>
      Suddenly, the wind picks up, the temperature drops
      and a heavy snowfall starts. Then, the wind and
      the snowing stops. A wall of white clouds forms
      a tall cylinder right above the PCs. A crystal blue
      sky can be seen above. The serenity comes with a
      cost – the temperature drops dramatically. Exposure
      can be lethal.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Any Zone travelers caught out in the open must immediately
      roll to Endure severe cold (page 93). One roll every
      15 minutes is required, until the cold spot passes (after D6
      hours) or the PCs move out of the sector. Lighting a fire can
      keep the cold at bay, but it requires firewood and an Agility
      roll (no skill used).
      </blockquote>
      <h6>Heat Wave</h6>
      The temperature suddenly peaks to an extreme
      level. The PCs find themselves panting and sweating
      profusely. Metal objects are painful to touch.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Anyone caught in the heat must make an Endure roll
      after performing any physical action. This roll doesn’t count
      as an action in itself – roll it immediately. Failure means
      suffering one point of fatigue. In addition, everyone suffering
      the Heat Wave must drink one ration of water every hour,
      or become Dehydrated (page 92). The Heat Wave lasts D6
      hours.

      <br/><br/>
      This entire area is scarred by gunshots and explosions.
      <br/><br/>In the ground, mines and/or unexploded grenades
      and bombs are hidden. Walking through this
      area is very dangerous.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Anyone who walks through the area must make a
      Move roll. Failure means triggering a Blast Power 6 explosion
      at Arm’s Length (page 94).

      33, Vacuum</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> -1
      <br/><br/>
      The PCs pass an area completely void of air. There
      is no visible explanation as to why the air does not
      fill this void. The first thing the PCs notice is that
      they cannot speak or breathe.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Anyone caught in the Vacuum must make a Move
      roll. Failure means that the victims panics and remains in
      the Vacuum another turn. Every turn in the Vacuum inflicts
      one point of damage. One roll to get out of the Vacuum is
      allowed per turn.
      </blockquote>

      34–36, Zone Smog</h5>
      <strong>Know the Zone Modifier:</strong> +1
      <br/><br/>
      A thick, yellowish fog rises from the ground. At first,
      is stays at knee-height, but soon it completely obscures
      vision. Eyes tear up and the smog burns the
      nose and mouth when breathing.
      <blockquote>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Everyone caught in the Zone Smog suffers one Rot
      Point. Vision is limited to Near range – the PCs cannot see (or
      Shoot at) anything farther away. Some Zone monsters take
      advantage of the Zone Smog to hunt – feel free to choose or
      roll one up. The only way to escape the smog is to find an
      elevated position like a tall building or a hill. The Zone Smog
      stays at ground level, and dissipates after D6 hours.
