    <p>{cmd_biohazard}</p>
    Your mutant powers run amok, and you suffer one point of
    permanent trauma. <br/><br/>You choose which attribute is affected.
    At the same time, you develop a new mutation.
  - |
    You suffer the effect of the mutation, and take as much
    trauma as your target. <br/><br/>If the mutation doesn’t cause
    trauma, you get disoriented instead and can’t act at all in
    the next turn.
  - |
    The mutation consumes twice the amount of MP you
    intended to spend on it – without increasing the effect. <br/><br/>You
    can’t drop below zero MP.
  - |
    The mutation locks down after this use. <br/><br/>You can’t use it
    again for the rest of the session.
  - |
    The mutation changes your appearance in some way. You
    choose how. <br/><br/>The effect is only cosmetic, but it is permanent.
  - |
    <p>{cmd_radioactive}</p>
    The mutation gets supercharged. <br/><br/>You get back the MP you
    just spent, and you can immediately – in the same turn –
    activate the same mutation again, against the same target
    or another.
