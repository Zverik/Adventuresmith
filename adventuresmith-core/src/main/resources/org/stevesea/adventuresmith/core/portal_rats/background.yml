    Elemental:
    - |
      You lived for untold years in the eye of the Everlasting Typhoon.
      There is a shantytown of survivors and daredevils in there, but
      your past beyond that is swept away.
      You roll with Advantage when predicting the weather, or acting in
      adverse weather conditions.
    - |
      You were born from the Exhalation of Susanoo, the impetuous
      brother of the Sun Herself. You spent your youth in free fall,
      watching floating worlds from afar.
      Falling does not hurt you. Ever.
    - |
      You were a guard in the opulent crystal palace of a djinn emir.
      You roll with Advantage to discover ambushes and tactical ruses.
    - |
      You worked as a night-farmer in the fields of Blind Storms. Down
      there in the endless dark you saw no light. Now you cannot get
      enough of it.
      You can see in the dark.
    - |
      You were a foraging slave in the maggot-men’s caves. You ate
      venomous grubs, blind tunnel-fish, and dirt to stay alive.
      You roll with Advantage against any ingested poison, including alcohol,
      spoiled food and brackish water.
    - |
      You were a freedom fighter in the doomed war against the
      Cacophonist. You saw your comrades cut down by his War
      Flautists. There will be a reckoning. You will raise an army and
      bring freedom to the Jungle of Reverberations.
      You are immune to sound-based attacks. You are also profoundly tonedeaf,
      and a bit suspicious of musicians.
    - |
      You walked for years behind a drudge-drake, plowing the Magma
      Plains.
      Heat and fire will not hurt you, unless you antagonize it.
    - |
      Your parents were rich merchants in Doon, grandest of the Nomad
      Cities floating on the elemental vortices.
      You start the game with +2 to CHA (up to a maximum of 19).
    - |
      You were a midwife in the City of Brass, cracking open molds and
      helping the infant ifrits take their first stumbling steps.
      You roll with Advantage against heat damage, and when dealing with
      small children (newlyhatched
      rocs, baby dragons, fussy infants, et cetera.)
    - |
      You were a boatman at the Wellspring of Rivers, just like your
      ancestors since time immemorial.
      You roll with Advantage when swimming or sailing. Also, you speak the
      language of amphibeans.
    - |
      Your mother was armorer to one of the Cinder Dukes. Which one?
      It matters not. They are forever at each other’s throats, ascending
      thrones or fleeing.
      You may appraise the worth of weapons accurately, and roll with
      Advantage when handling explosives and Greek fire.
    - |
      The Council of Frost has picked you to be thawed and sent to locate
      the new world of Soon as their envoy. You’re still a bit woozy from
      being chiseled out of the permafrost and dumped down a churning
      warp glacier.
      Cold doesn’t bother you, and you have 2 AP of icy armor.
    - |
      You lived in one of the Pearl Palaces under the Sea Without End.
      You were are teaboy or a parlor maid, an invisible menial in the
      heart of power. You may have slit a few narrow patrician throats
      before making your escape.
      You are a strong swimmer, and have gills. Your skin is turquoise scales,
      and you have webbed hands and feet.
    - |
      You came of age in Kettle, the metropolis at the Heart of Steam.
      Your eyebrows are singed and your hands calloused.
      You roll with Advantage when dealing with machines and steam-power.
    - |
      You were a stable hand at the court of Iskur, the Storm King.
      You rode the wild zephyr when no one looked, and polished the
      pegasi’s feathers.
      You roll with Advantage when riding or interacting with horses and
      horse-like beings.
    - |
      You lived an uneventful life on a floating island, sometimes
      buffered by cold winds, sometimes all all but resting on mighty
      waters. A tedious life! That was why you stowed away on a skyship
      bound for the Celestial Planes.
      You roll with Advantage when hiding (or farming, but you’d rather not).
    - |
      You were raised by masked nomads in the ash-dunes of Fires Past.
      Some of them must have been your parents. You eked out a living
      by scavenging, and spent your free hours searching for a way out.
      You found one.
      You have a mask, a second face which will fool anyone who hasn’t seen
      you before.
    - |
      You were a nurse in the Filth Meadows. You looked after the
      spawn of slug barons and ooze elementals, and became a power to
      be reckoned. Oh, but what does power matter if you live in mud
      and silt?
      Diseases and infections do not bother you. You may be slightly addicted to
      perfumes and incense.
    - |
      Dwarves carved you and your siblings out from the living rock.
      You were their spoiled golden children.
      You have two AP of rocky armor. Your features are beautifully chiseled,
      but you are a lot heavier than you look.
    - |
      You grew up in the place where the first raindrop fell on the first
      seed and begat the first tree. The rain never stopped, and the
      plants never ceased spreading. You were born of a large, obscenely
      colorful orchid.
      You have a pocket full of seeds. If you scatter them over even the thinnest
      layer of soil, they will grow into a forest within an hour.
    Upper:
    - |
      In Elysium you were a craftsman, working only with the most
      beautiful and perfect of materials. You worked hard, but the
      lightness of Elysium made it all seem insubstantial. Maybe it was
      rash to leave, but out here in the worlds you feel you make a
      difference. Your body aches from honest toil.
      You roll with Advantage when dealing with your craft (and you must
      decide what it is now).
    - |
      You bought your way into heaven. Now, celestials cannot be
      bribed, but you bought the name of a man who was virtuous but
      poor. In Elysium there is no time, but the cheat was discovered,
      and you were cast adrift in the universe. Somewhere out there
      there is a man who paid for your misdeeds, and he too is free from
      his assigned afterlife.
      Someone is coming after you. Talk briefly with the GM about your
      expectations in that regard. You start the game with +2 to CHA, as well as
      a red scar where a wroth angel touched you as you were thrown out of the
      Afterlife.
    - |
      You guarded a sylvan glade with word and spear. You had a
      thousand merry wars with fauns and elves.
      You start game with a spear, and a breastplate made from silver scales (4
      AP).
    - |
      You are an envoy for Ezur, the valley where Thought and Action
      are equally humble, and the Thunder Queen rules with the clarity
      of lightning and the weight of thunder. You have been sent out
      into the world to spread the good news of your Queen and her
      message of balance.
      You start the game with a shining broadsword and a cuirass (2 AP of
      armor).
    - |
      You tended the World Ash, whose leaves are stars and whose roots
      extend into the Abyss. You traded gossip with the squirrels, and
      fought the maggot-offspring of Nidhógg. The work, like the Tree
      requires renewal, and you were sent out into the world after
      uncounted years of golden toil.
      Whenever you meet someone with connection to Asgard, you may test
      CHA to see if you know something salacious or dark about them. You may
      do this once per individual.
    - |
      You were an agent of Dispater, in deep cover in Heaven. It was the
      greatest and most audacious strike against the Manors Benevolent
      since the elves learned speech. No one suspected a thing, and soon
      you felt at home among the well-ordered fields and orchards. This
      was Law without the threat of punishment, work without a shove
      of resentment or a dagger of ambition. You knew that you had to
      leave, as you were undeserving. One day you shall return, and your
      lies shall become truth.
      Once per day/level you may tell an undetectable lie. A person might think
      you’re wrong, but they will never think you lie.
    - |
      The Crystal Isle is a near-abandoned heaven, a place of cold
      perfection teetering on the edge of Order Itself. Those few who
      are sent here sit in silent contemplation of the crystals, until they
      become another part of of the breathtaking scenery. You could not
      quite make the transition.
      You may hurl shards ripped from your partly crystallized body. They do
      damage according to how closely the target is aligned with Order (GM’s
      discretion). Strongly aligned: no damage; somewhat aligned: 1d4 points;
      neutral (most people): 1d6 points; a force of chaos, progress, or anarchy:
      d10; a being straight out of Chaos Itself: 1d12 points of damage.
    - |
      Your reward was Nepenthe, a city build from fond memories and
      cool breezes. Like a dark mirror image the city of Lost Hope was
      beneath, dimly visible from towers and occasionally reflected in
      the river. You felt a deep compassion for those unfortunates, and
      were allowed to set out on a pilgrimage to give them Hope.
      Once per day you may give a person Hope, thus making them friendly
      towards you. The downside is that Hope shatters easily, and the target will
      blame you for making them hurt.
    - |
      You were one of the caretakers in the Stores of Wrath, where the
      Instruments of Just Retribution are kept. Your task was to make
      sure that the Behemoth was in working order. You tightened
      the bolts, cleaned the cogs, and polished the brass until it shone
      angrily. It filled your mind, the Behemoth did. Its hammering
      pistons, roaring furnace and seismic trumpeting. You saw temples
      broken under your feet, lances breaking against your metal flanks.
      You have left of your own volition to find mental fortitude and
      strength.
      Once per day you may call upon a pale reflection of the Behemoth’s
      unstoppable force. During one fight your fists (or similar) do 1d12 damage.
      This costs you 1d6 hit points, deducted after the end of the fight.
    - |
      You volunteered to leave Asgard. Intelligence was needed before
      the looming Last War. The doings of demons and giants have to be
      brought to the light, and they have to be put to the steel.
      You roll with Advantage to eavesdrop, and you always deal maximum
      damage to giants (GM’s got final say on what constitutes a giant).
    - |
      Heaven is a vast plain, full of gentle sun and crystal water. It is also
      a place where hunters and prey find a breathless comfort in their
      natural roles. You are a hunter.
      You may track by scent, provided that you have an idea what your prey
      smells like. You can see by low light, but not in complete darkness.
    - |
      You lived a simple life as a hunter and forager in the place they call
      the Green Dream. It was a heaven, but not for such as you. Trees of
      a million worlds come here and wander in vast herds, freed from
      their sessile duties.
      You speak the slow song-language of plants, but answers may be a long
      time in coming.
    - |
      You were a chef in Cornucopia, and you still smell of freshly baked
      bread and roast pork. Devas and celestials probably still talk of
      your broth and your herb rolls.
      You roll with Advantage when preparing or assessing food. You get -2 to
      all INT, WIS and CHA tests against those who have partaken of your food.
    - |
      You were a minor bureaucrat in the Sapphire City of Eternals, and
      a happy one. One day you were sent down to the World Archive for
      documentation. You must’ve lost your way somewhere, and things
      are less clear out here, but certainly interesting.
      You roll with Advantage when forging paperwork, and when gaining a
      favorable reaction from another bureaucrat.
    - |
      You were a minor celestial, given the unenviable task of serving
      the one thousand blessed fools. You quickly learned that the
      difference between a holy fool and the more common variety is
      minimal.
      You get -2 to INT and +2 to WIS. You are a mountain of restraint and common
      sense, but some idiocy has rubbed off on you.
    - |
      You spent a timeless eternity in the Asphodel Meadows, resting
      mutely under the vast trees. You were summoned out from under
      the eaves, and the offering of lamb’s blood gave you back your
      voice. Maybe one day you will go back to your righteous rest, but
      not now.
      You do not need food, drink, or breathable air. You revel in them though.
    - |
      In the Hidden Court sit twelve masked judges. They dispense
      gentle wisdom and stern imperatives to those who know to seek
      them out. They look not upon past deeds, only how a Seeker may
      become good. You were such a judge. These days you struggle with
      doubt, and seek experience in all the worlds.
      Once per day you may determine whether a statement is true or false, and
      whether the falsehood (or truth!) is intended. If the source of the statement
      is very powerful (GM’s decision), a WIS roll may be required.
    - |
      You were a minor functionary in the Bureaucracy of Color, which
      lies where Chaos laps at the shores of Heaven. You kept tally of
      hues, nuances and tints, a great responsibility, that only came with
      the bitter dregs of actual power. Roll a D6 to discover your color:
      1 Crimson: You hunger to vent your aggressions on the world. You inflict
      Critical Damage on 1s and 2s.
      2 Saffron: Once per session you can give Advantage to an ally’s roll by shouting
      encouragements and affirmations.
      3 Azure: You are a cerebral sort. You get +2 to INT, but -1 to STR and CON.
      4 Olive: You are familiar with envy and exaggeration. Once per session you may
      tell a lie and have all NPCs who hear it believe it. It must be utterly grand in
      scope though, or the GM is allowed to let your attempt fail. Those who have
      once believed one of your lies are immune in the future.
      5 Ecru You roll with Advantage when trying to calm someone with bland
      platitudes.
      6 Umber: You roll with Advantage when testing your CON. You leave a trail of
      brown dirt behind you everywhere.
    - |
      You dug watering canals in the beautiful orchards of Ceres. You
      know the value of honest toil, as well as the life-giving libation
      made from grain, grapes, apples and hops.
      You start with a +2 to CON (up to a maximum of 19). You roll with Advantage
      to hold your liquor.
    - |
      Your heaven was a place of excess and abandon, food, sex, music,
      as well as every drink and herb that one might want to partake of.
      Can an eternal reward become dull? Not to the truly deserving,
      seemed to be the consensus. You snuck out during a mid-morning
      orgy, with ambrosia, celestial wine, and emerald lotus under your
      toga.
      The comestibles of heaven have strange effects on those unused to them.
      You cannot communicate nor predict the possible effects, and of course
      they do not work on you. Their Usage die is D8. Each time a new person
      partakes, roll a d8:
      1 Nothing, but it tastes heavenly!
      2 Once eaten you learn a secret about the thing that is right in front of you.
      This knowledge comes with a side of kaleidoscopic lights, which start as a
      hallucination peculiar to you, but ‘infects’ those in the immediate vicinity.
      3 It heals 1d10 points of damage. Your hair turns a scintillating mother-ofpearl,
      and nothing but the will of a higher power can change that.
      4 It makes you pleasantly inebriated and is an antidote to most poisons.
      5 It makes you invisible to people who do not know you. This lasts for about
      ten minutes.
      6 You feel power course through you. You have Advantage on your next roll.
      7 For the next 1d6 hours your bodily fluids become holy water.
      8 You feel no pain for the next day (or similar cycle). The purely physical side
      is only a part of it, the you are free of emotional and psychological pain,
      including habits formed around a pain response which no longer has a
      trigger. Depending on the person, the response could range from reckless
      psychopathy, to relief and serenity, to a crippling new pain stemming from
      absence.
    Lower:
    - |
      Since you could walk you’ve been stomping grapes of bile and
      rage, under the watchful eyes of stupid and brutal giants. You
      will be a kind ruler, and turn all oppressors into bone-meal.
      You are immune to ingested poisons, and you roll with Advantage to
      appraise wine. Your back is a mass of cruel scars.
    - |
      You come from darkness, and have learned to hide from the
      shadow-filth that live in the failed Hell of Metzack.
      You roll with Advantage to hide in darkness or gloom. You can see in
      the dark.
    - |
      Your ancestors were fooled by Polyphon, the Archduke of Lies,
      and you have spent generations in his land of fog and false
      imaginings. Never let it be said you haven’t learned from past
      mistakes!
      You roll with Advantage on all WIS rolls to see through illusions.
    - |
      You spent aeons atoning for crimes you don’t remember
      anymore. In Tartarus all things are drained of color, energy, and
      life. When you found a tunnel which lead to another place, you
      didn’t think twice.
      You have no particular powers, but you get a +2 to INT and a -2 to WIS.
    - |
      You are cunning, but Tartarus has given you an unhealthy yearning
      for new experiences, no matter how dangerous: you may not wear
      armor.
      You died and went to Hel. This meant a near-eternity crewing
      Naglfar, the ship made from the nails of the dead.
      You are dead, which is obvious to all who see you. Once per session
      you can attempt to speak to some creature that has died. You roll with
      Advantage when you attempt to pilot a ship.
    - |
      Your home was the chained floating mesas that make up the
      Badlands of Heartless Law. You committed a crime, and had to
      run from justice. What does it matter what you did? You got
      away, and besides everything is a crime in that place.
      You are branded with a sigil of guilt. The nature of your crime is not
      apparent, but people seem to intuit that it is a punishment. The criminal
      class might take to you, but upstanding individuals won’t!

    - |
      In the afterlife you fought alongside other damned against the
      endless legions of barbed metal demons. You have been
      mutilated, disemboweled, and blown up more times than you
      can remember.
      You are dead, and you look it. You may choose to start the game with
      one of these demon- forged firearms:
      Bolt Spewer: A hunk of dull grey metal with a muzzle that disgorges metal bolts
      at an alarming rate. You can bypass the DEX test to hit and deal automatic
      damage but you have to roll the Ammo’s Usage die immediately. Usage die: d8
      Thunder Cannon: An ugly piece of pipe with a hand grip crudely attached.
      Roars like an angry god. Replace class damage with a d12; the Usage die for this
      gun is always a d6.
      Hellfire Jezzail: A long, slender rifle, adorned with etchings of demonic copulations
      and autocannibalism. You may skip a turn, aiming, and automatically
      deal damage the next turn. Roll Usage die at the end of the combat as per
      normal. Usage die: d10

    - |
      You are one of a few people who were born in the Birthgrave,
      on the corpse of a stillborn star. Here your parents fought the
      all-encompassing cosmic loss to scrape enough money together
      to send you off-world. Here you are now, basking in heady relief.
      You are still closely acquainted with titanic sorrows. Once per session
      you may test INT to paralyze an opponent with a raw unthinking memory
      of alien grief.
    - |
      You served your time on the Mountain of Knives. While your
      skin was flayed and flayed again, the worlds moved on. Now
      that you have been brought out to life again, you feel bereft of
      purpose.
      You are a frightening mass of scars. You have 2 AP of natural armor.
    - |
      The hell you’re from has no name. It is a place of absence. It
      doesn’t rain, and food is practically non-existent. There are
      few ruins which provide shadow, and the hungry ghosts fight
      desperate hopeless fights over these places, since the sun burns
      their dessicated skin.
      You possess a crude makeshift spear that may harm the living, the
      dead, and the incorporeal.
    - |
      Ours was not a hell, or any sordid place of punishment and
      sinners. We worked our fingers to the bone inside the World
      Engine. What will happen to the universe now that irresponsible
      angels have freed us?
      Your people were killed in the struggle between your saviors and
      overseers. You are the last of your kind, but their dust is still on your
      skin. You speak of yourself in the plural and never bathe. You roll with
      Advantage when trying to repair, operate, or understand machines.
    - |
      You lived a life on the run. Every night the Widows descend on
      you. Their hands and tongues were knives, and they meant to
      inscribe secrets on you, write a world history in wounds on you
      body. Inside and out. And so they did, until the day pilgrims
      rescued you.
      You may cut yourself for 1d3 damage and reveal an answer to a
      question. Lost hit points only heal between sessions.
    - |
      You were a tailor in Hell, and your creations were all the rage.
      The iron headdresses, the skirts of living skin, the dog heads
      stuffed with silver flies: that was all you. One day you used one
      of your horrid masterpieces as a disguise and made your escape.
      You own a garment which makes you appear as infernal nobility to
      most. It will give you Advantage on intimidation rolls, and a good deal
      of deference (or fear) from most normal people. It takes you an hour to
      put it on, and while you’re wearing it you do not heal any damage.
    - |
      Your punishment for dereliction of duty was the Sea Grave, the
      dark ocean where sinners drown eternally, but never die.
      You can’t drown or die from lack of breathable air.
    - |
      They blinded you and left you in an endless cave. You felt along
      the walls, and fought the feral things that lived there. Perhaps
      they were once like you. Have you made it out at all?
      You are blind, and thus immune to attacks which depend on eyesight.
      Your other senses are sharp enough to compensate, but you cannot
      read or consult a map.
    - |
      You spent an aeon in the form of a nightmare, a demon horse.
      You were one of the Crone Empress’s favorite mounts. Of course,
      someone learned of the pride you took in your position, and you
      were cursed with the weak biped shape you now wear.
      Your feet remain iron hooves, and you may run as fast as a charger.
    - |
      You made quite a fortune as a dung farmer. The underworld has
      some potent waste, and you were the one to fight through the
      instinctive disgust and hit paydirt, as it were. Envy was your
      downfall, as your siblings robbed you of your empire, with the
      help of Dispater’s greatest legal minds. They will all pay. And
      pay again.
      You are immune to attacks which depend on foul odors or revulsion.
    - |
      You’re not a person. You’re a collective of imps disguised in this
      human-suit. Pretty shrewd, eh?
      Imps are nimble (+2 to DEX), but not all that good at pulling in the
      same direction (-2 to STR). Once per session you may discorporate to
      avoid an attack. It will take you 1D6 turns to put yourself back together
      again, though.
    - |
      You ran through the city of Lost Hope, where forgotten cities
      and forgotten people end up, tormented by grief connected to
      lost memories. High above its Heavenly mirror image (called
      Nepenthe) glimmered. You started your ascend on crumbling
      stairs and precarious roofs, and wound up in a different city
      altogether. Perhaps all cities meet at one glorious point?
      You gain Advantage on all DEX rolls in an urban environment.

      You have forgotten your mortal life in the Madlands where the
      Lower is touched by Chaos Itself. There is nothing to depend on,
      whether place, time, or the certainties of one’s own body. There
      is no security either, and you managed to escape one day when
      you had wings. But Chaos is eternal and Hell has a long memory.
      Maybe your path will send you back to the Madlands if you are
      not careful.
      Chaos still rumbles and churns within you. Other creatures that are
      touched by chaos will seek you out, and and their attitude will be
      predictably unpredictable. Once per session you may spit forth a glob
      of Chaos which has one of the following effects; roll 1d8, and once an
      effect has occurred, cross it off the list and replace it with a new one:
      1 The target takes 1D8 points of damage and catches fire.
      2 Everyone but you and the target turn into pigs. Powerful creatures may be
      able to simply turn back into their real form.
      3 You rob the target of 1D6 hit points (which you may add to your own, but
      they disappear the next time you sleep).
      4 The target can only communicate in song.
      5 The target turns into a copy of you.
      6 The target itself turns into raw Chaos for 1D6 turns. Chaos does no harm,
      unless you touch it.
      7 You turn into Chaos as above.
      8 The glob does 1D4 damage per level you possess.
    Transitory:

      The Shroud stretches through the lightless caves of the Elemental,
      the endless night of Hells, and the arctic nights of many primes.
      Your tribe was nomadic thieves, stealing to stay alive, moving
      to keep ahead of the repercussions. It was a life you were caught
      red-handed by Elysian paladins. Only you escaped.
      You can see in darkness, and generally prefer it.
    - |
      You entered the Shroud as a Torchbearer, a growing cult
      dedicated to enlightenment in a literal and figurative sense. Your
      faith-powered light cannons were no match for the Universe of
      Night. You barely made it out, and now home is nowhere.
      Once per day you may cast a Light spell. It lasts until you dismiss it.
    - |
      Near Chaos Itself lies the island called Inspiration. It is never the
      same two days in a row. One might go to sleep in a bed and wake
      up in a giant lilly. Most people revel in it, but you took your leave
      as soon as you could. Eating crusts next to a campfire is surprisingly
      reassuring.
      You own a piece of Potential, a blue blob about the size of your hand. You
      can turn it into any (non-magical) item of that size. It returns to blobform
      after 1d10 hours. You can turn it into food, or some other perishable
      item, in which case it is used up.
    - |
      You were an Astral pirate from a long line of black-hearted
      scoundrels. You were caught by the authorities on the Halcyon
      Isles. You were subjected to hard labor, but also to freely given
      kindness, and the opportunity to learn. After many years you
      were released a better person.
      You roll with Advantage when climbing, and when dealing with a
      scholarly subject of your choice. Your family might be coming for you
      though.
    - |
      You are a creature of the Cacophonist, a living song, trapped in a
      humanoid body of ebony and brass.
      You have a beautiful singing voice, but you are incapable of experiencing
      any physical sensation. You may imitate any sound that you have heard.
    - |
      Your mother was a Rightly-Guided Sky Captain, ferrying the
      worthy across the Astral in a golden barge. She brought you along
      with her.
      You roll with Advantage for piloting a ship, as well as all rope-work.
    - |
      Who your parents were remains a mystery, but you grew up alone
      in the city of Cordoa, which all giants consider their lost home.
      You ate gargantuan table-scraps, fought monstrous vermin, and
      with time grew to a prodigious size yourself.
      You start the game with a STR of 18. You are nine feet tall, heavy as a
      draft horse, and eat like one too.
    - |
      You’re from the place that outsiders call Ethereal. Here you
      worked since an early age in the fog spinneries. You have gained
      much substance since you left, but your are still kin to ghosts and
      mirages.
      Once per session you may become liminal, gaining Advantage to all hiding
      and sneaking rolls for an hour. Alternately you may become
      completely intangible for the time it takes to ignore a blow or pass
      through a single wall.
    - |
      You are a journeyman claviger, a key-maker and opener of doors.
      You opened a portal which lead you to the Astral. This place leads
      everywhere!
      You roll with Advantage when picking locks and sussing out the
      operational rules of a portal or gate.
    - |
      The 10,000 Shining Isles have always fought the Levitaton Empire
      in endless skyship battles. You were a newly conscripted mariner,
      who got thrown into the wild Astral by the first cannon volley.
      When you were recovered by strangers, barnacles covered your
      body like a pearlescent carapace.
      You have 1 AP of natural armor, and you roll with Advantage when dealing
      with cannons and the like.
    - |
      You were the spoiled child of Imperial nobles. In a tantrum you
      ran off, and are starting to realize that the world is quite hard,
      even if the plebs are powerfully stupid!
      Your family name may open some doors, depending on where you go.
      You roll with Advantage when appraising wine, gems, and riding
      animals. Your nanny is on your scent by the way, her pistons clanking,
      her golden hooves thrumming relentlessly.
    - |
      You are a cloud doctor, traveling the Astral, helping people with
      problems relating to the multitudes of miasma, mists, and
      condensations that seem to occur so frequently here.
      You roll with Advantage when diagnosing and identifying clouds and
      related illnesses. Once per day you may roll to make a dangerous cloud
      inert, or heal 1d6 hit points worth of cloud-related damage (distributed
      as you wish).
    - |
      Your city was a floating sky-marvel, until it was cursed by the
      horrid Cacophonist to become one great mind inhabiting many
      bodies. With this the Cacophonist hoped to create a choir
      greater than the Heavenly Host itself. You have lived your life
      in the warm oceanic feeling of the hive mind, always being part
      of the harmonious chorus. You stumbled through a portal, and
      ended up in this new world. Stranger still is the feeling of having
      an identity of your own.
      You have perfect pitch, and may communicate telepathically with any
      one being out to a range of Near.
    - |
      You were a city guard in one of the ports of the 10,000 Shining
      Isles. You saw the world pass by, while you performed your simple
      duty. One day you walked away to give the rest of creation its due.
      You start the game with a spear, a crossbow, and a chainmail hauberk
      (6 AP). You roll with Advantage on rolls against ambushes and other
      surprise attacks.
    - |
      Your floating island was a peaceful place of rice paddies and
      gentle mist, until the fugitive angel Penemue passed by, brushing
      your home with its bright garments. Enlightenment drove many
      mad, but you managed to contain this new wisdom. Your home
      seemed limiting and prosaic though, and you soon hitch a ride on
      a skyship.
      You start with a +2 to INT and WIS(!) but a -2 to CON. You roll with
      Advantage when trying to decipher written language or code.
    - |
      As the Astral approaches Law Itself, it hardens and becomes stairs,
      walkways and balustrades. Your parents were traveling peddlers
      of trinkets and talismans on those stairs.
      You own a talisman made from a deva’s feather. Once per session you
      may invoke it to gain Advantage on one roll. Alternately you may destroy
      the talisman and survive a fall from any height.
    - |
      Love is a wild ungovernable force, despite what Tu Er Shen,
      Aphrodite or Cupid might tell you. You know, since your
      livelihood is scavenging in the ruined Manors of those very gods,
      torn loose from the Upper Planes. It’s dangerous, and often
      melancholy and filthy. You are done eating nothing but oysters
      and strawberries dug out of throbbing rubble!
      Once per session you may cast the equivalent of a Charm spell, but only if
      you don’t believe a thing you’re saying.
    - |
      Before a person is born there is a grim, naked struggle to be the
      one to enter into the mortal realms. Sexless maggot-creatures
      tearing into each other, all for the dubious honor of being born.
      You fought your way across the gray and blood-slicked battlefield,
      and expected to find yourself being nursed, burped and doted on.
      This body was not what you expected.
      You are right at home fighting against hordes of opponents. When you
      roll a 1 in combat, you may hit 1d4+1 opponents at the same time. (You
      only deal Critical Damage to one foe, though.)
    - |
      Imagine a city full of knowledge, whose only purpose is storing
      knowledge. That is the libraries of Gann, floating in the Astral.
      You are a young librarian, out in the worlds looking for that gathering
      of information that will make your name and your specialization.
      1 Celestial Planes: You roll with Advantage when dealing with the Upper and
      Lower planes, their geography, politics and customs.
      2 Elemental Planes: You roll with Advantage when dealing with lore
      concerning the Elemental planes, their geography, politics and makeup.
      3 Primes: You roll with Advantage when recalling the strange lore of the
      Primes, their beliefs, symbols and place.
      4 Astral: You roll with Advantage when recalling the lkore of the Astral, who
      lives on the islands, and where portals may lead.
      5 Sensation: Once per day you may produce a sensation from the vast archive.
      It is not real in the sense that it cannot do physical weal or woe, but it may
      have a profound effect on the recipient.
      6 Dead Lore: Once per day you may call forth a dead idea. Again, this does not
      have a physical reality, but may have a profound effect on the recipient.
      Some example dead ideas:
      Gluttox: There is no difference between food and not-food
      Absensation: The utterly paradoxical, yet peaceful feeling of non-existence.
      When it disappears, the weight of existence may be lethal.
      Onis: Being suddenly conscious of the fact that being trapped in one
      biological entity, locked in by time and space, is profoundly unnatural.
      Sonder: A sudden oceanic certainty that every living soul is as complete a
      being as you. A paralyzing moment of total empathy.
    - |
      As the Astral approaches Chaos Itself, it becomes a bewildering
      array of creatures given substance by the aether and form by the
      forces of whim and impulse. Most of these beings are nonviable,
      or fall to their death. Not you.
      You start the game with +2 to CON, and you must roll 1d3 times on the
      Mutations table below.
      1 You contain a star seed. When you die you will become an infant sun!
      2 Ungainly, muscular hulk (STR 16, DEX 6)
      3 Grey bat-like wings. You can fly.
      4 Octopus-like suckers growing from skin. You roll with Advantage when
      climbing.
      5 Insectile carapace giving 2 points of armor
      6 No head. Your face is in your chest.
      7 Body odor is like honey and coriander.
      8 Entire body lumpy and tumorous.
      9 Fetus-like parasite twin. Once per session it may whisper a warning of
      nearby danger.
      10 Hippopotamus-headed
      11 Beautiful singing voice
      12 Body grotesquely fat. You roll with Advantage on CHA rolls dealing with
      demons of gluttony.
      13 Body covered with coarse orange fur. You are immune to cold.
      14 1d6+1 arms
      15 Angelic features (+2 CHA)
      16 No mouth but a pair of metallic mandibles (damage 1d6)
      17 Mouth at the end of a fleshy proboscis
      18 Eyes are fish-like and never blink
      19 Eyes are yellow, veiny, and three in number
      20 Eyes on long, prehensile, snail-like stalks
    Prime:
    - |
      Your world is rubble, atomized by the generational struggle of the six
      Warlock Houses. You did not want to leave, but there was no place to
      stay, nor any ground to stand on.
      You roll with Advantage to avoid magical attacks.
    - |
      You were a pampered plaything of the golden elves in the Forests of
      Keriel. One day you explored the Oracle’s hut, and found a crack in
      the wall to hide in when she returned. You have yet to find your way
      out.
      You start with a CHA of 16.
    - |
      You were a carpenter’s apprentice in the village of Packton Green. It
      was boring and safe, until the Filth Hounds invaded from some
      unimaginable hell. One of them swallowed you up.
      You roll with Advantage when working with wood, appraising or haggling
      over wooden objects.
    - |
      You plowed the meager fields of your homestead in the Silver Hills.
      One day your plowing uncovered a scintillating hand mirror.
      You have that mirror still, although it continues to be a mystery. It clearly
      has some magic to it. Something connected with travel.
    - |
      You were a proud citizen of the Seven Tribes Confederacy. Others call
      you barbarian. You call them soft.
      Start the game with a +2 to either STR, CON or DEX, as well as a -2 to either
      INT or CHA.
    - |
      In Kornhaime where you’re from, the grindstones are bigger than
      castles. You worked your fingers to the bone in the immense mills,
      until one evening when a voice seemed to beckon you from one of the
      grain silos.
      Once per day you may Purify any grain-based comestible.
    - |
      Your people had ascended to greatness, and in the bid for ultimate
      power you hunted and devoured your gods. Little did you know that
      they were the only thing which kept your world from tumbling into
      the darkness they call the Shroud. Now you are lost among
      night-logged worlds, and so very hungry!
      A small piece of the Corpus Divine is still lodged in your stomach lining. Once
      per day you may either Bless a person (giving them Advantage on a roll),
      Smite a person (with 1d8 points of damage, as along as you can see them), or
      project your voice so that it booms like a divine edict, and may be heard for
      miles.
    - |
      You were in Lord Ethis the Righteous’ retinue when he descended
      into the Pit of Iniquity. He was soon undone, and you bolted. Anyone
      would have done so!
      Your sword glows when in the presence of demonic evil. In many places it just
      won’t quit.
    - |
      You are on the run from the Undertaker Whales who guard the
      Cetacean Graveyard. You are a grave robber, but purely out of need.
      You have a bagful of ambergris, which is potentially worth a fortune.
    - |
      Your home was Canopy, where cities grow on trees, and nomadic
      tribes travel at the bosom of titanic sloth-beasts.
      You roll with Advantage when climbing (and when attempting to calm a
      spooked beast of burden, irrespective of its size).
    - |
      You tended the gardens that grow on the Sleeping Ones’ mausoleum.
      One day your fool son went exploring in there. Of course you had to
      go in and get him.
      You roll with Advantage when dealing with matters of gardening, botany,
      and plants. This includes communicating and impressing plant-creatures.
    - |
      Your world was still being formed by the warring wills of the gods.
      During one upheaval, the lake next to your farm rose up as a great
      beast and washed you out of the world.
      You are no stranger to adverse fighting conditions. If terrain would give you
      Disadvantage on a physical roll, you may ignore it.
    - |
      You were given in marriage to the Mage Supreme. One day you tried
      one of their forbidden doors. Behind it was a world of ghostly paths
      and gently humming insects.
      You know a single cantrip, learned from your preoccupied spouse:
      Song of the Spring Rose
      You sing a nonsense verse, and one Nearby person sees the world as a kinder
      place, and problems as less insurmountable. Roll WIS against subjects who
      would resist the effect. You may use this cantrip once per day.
    - |
      You were a child apprentice in the Third Great Necropolis. You slept
      among the dead, and suckled at the Corpse Mother’s teat (praise due
      to Her). You were sent to the Afterlives to complete your education.
      No dead person will initiate hostilities against you. This does not extend to
      your companions, nor does it keep them from lying to you, informing on you,
      or overcharging you.
    - |
      You were a farrier of such skill and renown that the Kestrel Princess
      of the Seven Winds heard of you and had you abducted.
      You speak the language of horses (also spoken by unicorns, zephyrs, nightmares
      and pegasi). If you need to roll when shoeing a horse (or horse-like
      creature) you roll with Advantage.
    - |
      You hatched from a crimson egg that was left in the care of the
      Sisterhood of Ptah. They raised you to explore and walk through every
      door until you found home.
      Your blood holds the blessing of Ptah. You may cut yourself for 1d4 damage
      and use your blood as a universal portal key. You need to know of the portal’s
      existence and location for this to work, but not its destination.
    - |
      You piloted one of the Witch-Queen’s longships as her undead draugr
      rowed tirelessly. During one brutal raid of the world’s shores you
      slipped away.
      You can talk with the undead, no matter what language they spoke in life.
      Their level of intellect greatly influences the degree to which they talk back.
    - |
      You escaped the Glass Mountain’s stultifying pleasures, and the
      automata Protectors who would keep humanity there for its own
      good. The world beyond is full of deep and wondrous chasms to explore.
      The Protectors imbued you with a protective measure. You roll with Advantage
      against diseases, poisons and venoms.
    - |
      You home was the metropolis of Buer, where humans and penitent
      demons met and built a smoke-belching city of industry, speed and
      love. Of course some curious fools had to explore the cave from
      whence the demons came. You are the latest of such fools.
      There is something of the lower planes about you. You roll with Advantage
      against environmental hazards of the Lower planes.
    - |
      Your world was spent, and you left with your idols, your family and
      your livestock in a silver ship to fins a new home. You stole that ship,
      but then the situation was dire.
      You have a poorly-understood silver ship which may fly, but has a d6 utility
      die. There must be something that unlocks its secrets and recharges its
      magic.
