      <h6>Crimson:</h6>You hunger to vent your aggressions on the world. You inflict Critical Damage on 1s and 2s.
    - |
      <h6>Saffron:</h6> Once per session you can give Advantage to an ally’s roll by shouting encouragements and affirmations.
    - |
      <h6>Azure:</h6> You are a cerebral sort. You get +2 to INT, but -1 to STR and CON.
    - |
      <h6>Olive:</h6> You are familiar with envy and exaggeration. Once per session you may
      tell a lie and have all NPCs who hear it believe it. It must be utterly grand in
      scope though, or the GM is allowed to let your attempt fail. Those who have
      once believed one of your lies are immune in the future.
    - |
      <h6>Ecru:</h6> You roll with Advantage when trying to calm someone with bland platitudes.
    - |
      <h6>Umber:</h6> You roll with Advantage when testing your CON. You leave a trail of brown dirt behind you everywhere.

    - |
      <h6>Sensation:</h6> Once per day you may produce a sensation from the vast archive. It is not real in the sense that it cannot do physical weal or woe, but it may have a profound effect on the recipient.
    - |
      <h6>Dead Lore:</h6> Once per day you may call forth a dead idea. Again, this does not have a physical reality, but may have a profound effect on the recipient.
      Some example dead ideas:
      <br/>
      <u>Gluttox:</u> There is no difference between food and not-food
      <br/>
      <u>Absensation:</u> The utterly paradoxical, yet peaceful feeling of non-existence.
      When it disappears, the weight of existence may be lethal.
      <br/>
      <u>Onis:</u> Being suddenly conscious of the fact that being trapped in one
      biological entity, locked in by time and space, is profoundly unnatural.
      <br/>
      <u>Sonder:</u> A sudden oceanic certainty that every living soul is as complete a
      being as you. A paralyzing moment of total empathy.

      language of amphibeans.
      </em></p>
    - |
      Your mother was armorer to one of the Cinder Dukes. Which one?
      It matters not. They are forever at each other’s throats, ascending
      thrones or fleeing.
      <p><em>
      You may appraise the worth of weapons accurately, and roll with
      Advantage when handling explosives and Greek fire.
      </em></p>

      The Council of Frost has picked you to be thawed and sent to locate
      the new world of Soon as their envoy. You’re still a bit woozy from
      being chiseled out of the permafrost and dumped down a churning
      warp glacier.

      Cold doesn’t bother you, and you have 2 AP of icy armor.

      You lived in one of the Pearl Palaces under the Sea Without End.
      You were are teaboy or a parlor maid, an invisible menial in the
      heart of power. You may have slit a few narrow patrician throats
      before making your escape.

      You are a strong swimmer, and have gills. Your skin is turquoise scales,
      and you have webbed hands and feet.

      You were a stable hand at the court of Iskur, the Storm King.
      You rode the wild zephyr when no one looked, and polished the
      pegasi’s feathers.
      <p><em>
      You roll with Advantage when riding or interacting with horses and
      horse-like beings.
      </em></p>
    - |
      You lived an uneventful life on a floating island, sometimes
      buffered by cold winds, sometimes all all but resting on mighty
      waters. A tedious life! That was why you stowed away on a skyship
      bound for the Celestial Planes.
      <p><em>
      You roll with Advantage when hiding (or farming, but you’d rather not).
      </em></p>
    - |
      You were raised by masked nomads in the ash-dunes of Fires Past.
      Some of them must have been your parents. You eked out a living
      by scavenging, and spent your free hours searching for a way out.
      <br/>
      You found one.
      <p><em>
      You have a mask, a second face which will fool anyone who hasn’t seen
      you before.
      </em></p>
    - |
      You were a nurse in the Filth Meadows. You looked after the
      spawn of slug barons and ooze elementals, and became a power to
      be reckoned. Oh, but what does power matter if you live in mud
      and silt?
      <p><em>
      Diseases and infections do not bother you. You may be slightly addicted to
      perfumes and incense.

      Dwarves carved you and your siblings out from the living rock.
      You were their spoiled golden children.

      You grew up in the place where the first raindrop fell on the first
      seed and begat the first tree. The rain never stopped, and the
      plants never ceased spreading. You were born of a large, obscenely
      colorful orchid.
      <p><em>
      You have a pocket full of seeds. If you scatter them over even the thinnest
      layer of soil, they will grow into a forest within an hour.

      In Elysium you were a craftsman, working only with the most
      beautiful and perfect of materials. You worked hard, but the
      lightness of Elysium made it all seem insubstantial. Maybe it was
      rash to leave, but out here in the worlds you feel you make a
      difference. Your body aches from honest toil.
      <p><em>
      You roll with Advantage when dealing with your craft (and you must
      decide what it is now).
      </em></p>
    - |
      You bought your way into heaven. Now, celestials cannot be
      bribed, but you bought the name of a man who was virtuous but
      poor. In Elysium there is no time, but the cheat was discovered,
      and you were cast adrift in the universe. Somewhere out there
      there is a man who paid for your misdeeds, and he too is free from
      his assigned afterlife.
      <p><em>
      Someone is coming after you. Talk briefly with the GM about your
      expectations in that regard. You start the game with +2 to CHA, as well as
      a red scar where a wroth angel touched you as you were thrown out of the
      Afterlife.
      </em></p>
    - |
      You guarded a sylvan glade with word and spear. You had a
      thousand merry wars with fauns and elves.
      <p><em>
      You start game with a spear, and a breastplate made from silver scales (4 AP).
      </em></p>
    - |
      You are an envoy for Ezur, the valley where Thought and Action
      are equally humble, and the Thunder Queen rules with the clarity
      of lightning and the weight of thunder. You have been sent out
      into the world to spread the good news of your Queen and her
      message of balance.
      <p><em>
      You start the game with a shining broadsword and a cuirass (2 AP of
      armor).

      You tended the World Ash, whose leaves are stars and whose roots
      extend into the Abyss. You traded gossip with the squirrels, and
      fought the maggot-offspring of Nidhógg. The work, like the Tree
      requires renewal, and you were sent out into the world after
      uncounted years of golden toil.
      <p><em>
      Whenever you meet someone with connection to Asgard, you may test
      CHA to see if you know something salacious or dark about them. You may
      do this once per individual.
      </em></p>
    - |
      You were an agent of Dispater, in deep cover in Heaven. It was the
      greatest and most audacious strike against the Manors Benevolent
      since the elves learned speech. No one suspected a thing, and soon
      you felt at home among the well-ordered fields and orchards. This
      was Law without the threat of punishment, work without a shove
      of resentment or a dagger of ambition. You knew that you had to
      leave, as you were undeserving. One day you shall return, and your
      lies shall become truth.
      <p><em>
      Once per day/level you may tell an undetectable lie. A person might think
      you’re wrong, but they will never think you lie.

      The Crystal Isle is a near-abandoned heaven, a place of cold
      perfection teetering on the edge of Order Itself. Those few who
      are sent here sit in silent contemplation of the crystals, until they
      become another part of of the breathtaking scenery. You could not
      quite make the transition.
      <p><em>
      You may hurl shards ripped from your partly crystallized body. They do
      damage according to how closely the target is aligned with Order (GM’s
      discretion). Strongly aligned: no damage; somewhat aligned: 1d4 points;
      neutral (most people): 1d6 points; a force of chaos, progress, or anarchy:
      d10; a being straight out of Chaos Itself: 1d12 points of damage.

      Your reward was Nepenthe, a city build from fond memories and
      cool breezes. Like a dark mirror image the city of Lost Hope was
      beneath, dimly visible from towers and occasionally reflected in
      the river. You felt a deep compassion for those unfortunates, and
      were allowed to set out on a pilgrimage to give them Hope.
      <p><em>
      Once per day you may give a person Hope, thus making them friendly
      towards you. The downside is that Hope shatters easily, and the target will
      blame you for making them hurt.

    - |
      You were one of the caretakers in the Stores of Wrath, where the
      Instruments of Just Retribution are kept. Your task was to make
      sure that the Behemoth was in working order. You tightened
      the bolts, cleaned the cogs, and polished the brass until it shone
      angrily. It filled your mind, the Behemoth did. Its hammering
      pistons, roaring furnace and seismic trumpeting. You saw temples
      broken under your feet, lances breaking against your metal flanks.
      <br/>
      You have left of your own volition to find mental fortitude and
      strength.
      <p><em>
      Once per day you may call upon a pale reflection of the Behemoth’s
      unstoppable force. During one fight your fists (or similar) do 1d12 damage.
      This costs you 1d6 hit points, deducted after the end of the fight.

    - |
      You volunteered to leave Asgard. Intelligence was needed before
      the looming Last War. The doings of demons and giants have to be
      brought to the light, and they have to be put to the steel.
      <p><em>
      You roll with Advantage to eavesdrop, and you always deal maximum
      damage to giants (GM’s got final say on what constitutes a giant).

      Heaven is a vast plain, full of gentle sun and crystal water. It is also
      a place where hunters and prey find a breathless comfort in their
      natural roles. You are a hunter.
      <p><em>
      You may track by scent, provided that you have an idea what your prey
      smells like. You can see by low light, but not in complete darkness.
      </em></p>
    - |
      You lived a simple life as a hunter and forager in the place they call
      the Green Dream. It was a heaven, but not for such as you. Trees of
      a million worlds come here and wander in vast herds, freed from
      their sessile duties.
      <p><em>
      You speak the slow song-language of plants, but answers may be a long
      time in coming.

      You were a chef in Cornucopia, and you still smell of freshly baked
      bread and roast pork. Devas and celestials probably still talk of
      your broth and your herb rolls.
      <p><em>
      You roll with Advantage when preparing or assessing food. You get -2 to
      all INT, WIS and CHA tests against those who have partaken of your food.
      </em></p>
    - |
      You were a minor bureaucrat in the Sapphire City of Eternals, and
      a happy one. One day you were sent down to the World Archive for
      documentation. You must’ve lost your way somewhere, and things
      are less clear out here, but certainly interesting.
      <p><em>
      You roll with Advantage when forging paperwork, and when gaining a
      favorable reaction from another bureaucrat.
      </em></p>

      You were a minor celestial, given the unenviable task of serving
      the one thousand blessed fools. You quickly learned that the
      difference between a holy fool and the more common variety is
      minimal.
      <p><em>
      You get -2 to INT and +2 to WIS. You are a mountain of restraint and common
      sense, but some idiocy has rubbed off on you.

    - |
      You spent a timeless eternity in the Asphodel Meadows, resting
      mutely under the vast trees. You were summoned out from under
      the eaves, and the offering of lamb’s blood gave you back your
      voice. Maybe one day you will go back to your righteous rest, but
      not now.

      In the Hidden Court sit twelve masked judges. They dispense
      gentle wisdom and stern imperatives to those who know to seek
      them out. They look not upon past deeds, only how a Seeker may
      become good. You were such a judge. These days you struggle with
      doubt, and seek experience in all the worlds.

      Once per day you may determine whether a statement is true or false, and

      You were a minor functionary in the Bureaucracy of Color, which

      made from grain, grapes, apples and hops.

      Your heaven was a place of excess and abandon, food, sex, music,
      as well as every drink and herb that one might want to partake of.
      Can an eternal reward become dull? Not to the truly deserving,
      seemed to be the consensus. You snuck out during a mid-morning
      orgy, with ambrosia, celestial wine, and emerald lotus under your
      toga.
      <p><em>
      The comestibles of heaven have strange effects on those unused to them.
      <br/>
      You cannot communicate nor predict the possible effects, and of course
      they do not work on you. Their Usage die is D8. Each time a new person
      partakes, roll a d8:
      <br/>
      <strong>1</strong> Nothing, but it tastes heavenly!
      <br/>
      <strong>2</strong> Once eaten you learn a secret about the thing that is right in front of you.
      This knowledge comes with a side of kaleidoscopic lights, which start as a
      hallucination peculiar to you, but ‘infects’ those in the immediate vicinity.
      <br/>
      <strong>3</strong> It heals 1d10 points of damage. Your hair turns a scintillating mother-ofpearl,
      and nothing but the will of a higher power can change that.
      <br/>
      <strong>4</strong> It makes you pleasantly inebriated and is an antidote to most poisons.
      <br/>
      <strong>5</strong> It makes you invisible to people who do not know you. This lasts for about
      ten minutes.
      <br/>
      <strong>6</strong> You feel power course through you. You have Advantage on your next roll.
      <br/>
      <strong>7</strong> For the next 1d6 hours your bodily fluids become holy water.
      <br/>
      <strong>8</strong> You feel no pain for the next day (or similar cycle). The purely physical side
      is only a part of it, the you are free of emotional and psychological pain,
      including habits formed around a pain response which no longer has a
      trigger. Depending on the person, the response could range from reckless
      psychopathy, to relief and serenity, to a crippling new pain stemming from
      absence.

      Your home was the chained floating mesas that make up the
      Badlands of Heartless Law. You committed a crime, and had to
      run from justice. What does it matter what you did? You got
      away, and besides everything is a crime in that place.

      You are branded with a sigil of guilt. The nature of your crime is not

      You are dead, and you look it. You may choose to start the game with
      one of these demon-forged firearms:

      <strong>Bolt Spewer:</strong> A hunk of dull grey metal with a muzzle that disgorges metal bolts
      at an alarming rate. You can bypass the DEX test to hit and deal automatic
      damage but you have to roll the Ammo’s Usage die immediately. Usage die: d8
      <br/>
      <strong>Thunder Cannon:</strong> An ugly piece of pipe with a hand grip crudely attached.
      Roars like an angry god. Replace class damage with a d12; the Usage die for this
      gun is always a d6.
      <br/>
      <strong>Hellfire Jezzail:</strong>  A long, slender rifle, adorned with etchings of demonic copulations
      and autocannibalism. You may skip a turn, aiming, and automatically
      deal damage the next turn. Roll Usage die at the end of the combat as per
      normal. Usage die: d10

      You are one of a few people who were born in the Birthgrave,

      to send you off-world. Here you are now, basking in heady relief.

      The hell you’re from has no name. It is a place of absence. It
      doesn’t rain, and food is practically non-existent. There are
      few ruins which provide shadow, and the hungry ghosts fight
      desperate hopeless fights over these places, since the sun burns
      their dessicated skin.

      You lived a life on the run. Every night the Widows descend on
      you. Their hands and tongues were knives, and they meant to

      rescued you.

      You own a garment which makes you appear as infernal nobility to
      most. It will give you Advantage on intimidation rolls, and a good deal

      put it on, and while you’re wearing it you do not heal any damage.

      You made quite a fortune as a dung farmer. The underworld has
      some potent waste, and you were the one to fight through the
      instinctive disgust and hit paydirt, as it were. Envy was your
      downfall, as your siblings robbed you of your empire, with the
      help of Dispater’s greatest legal minds. They will all pay. And

      Imps are nimble (+2 to DEX), but not all that good at pulling in the
      same direction (-2 to STR). Once per session you may discorporate to

      You ran through the city of Lost Hope, where forgotten cities
      and forgotten people end up, tormented by grief connected to
      lost memories. High above its Heavenly mirror image (called
      Nepenthe) glimmered. You started your ascend on crumbling
      stairs and precarious roofs, and wound up in a different city
      altogether. Perhaps all cities meet at one glorious point?

      You have forgotten your mortal life in the Madlands where the
      Lower is touched by Chaos Itself. There is nothing to depend on,
      whether place, time, or the certainties of one’s own body. There
      is no security either, and you managed to escape one day when
      you had wings. But Chaos is eternal and Hell has a long memory.
      Maybe your path will send you back to the Madlands if you are
      not careful.
      <p><em>
      Chaos still rumbles and churns within you. Other creatures that are
      touched by chaos will seek you out, and and their attitude will be
      predictably unpredictable. Once per session you may spit forth a glob
      of Chaos which has one of the following effects; roll 1d8, and once an
      effect has occurred, cross it off the list and replace it with a new one:
      <br/>
      <strong>1</strong> The target takes 1D8 points of damage and catches fire.
      <br/>
      <strong>2</strong> Everyone but you and the target turn into pigs. Powerful creatures may be able to simply turn back into their real form.
      <br/>
      <strong>3</strong> You rob the target of 1D6 hit points (which you may add to your own, but they disappear the next time you sleep).
      <br/>
      <strong>4</strong> The target can only communicate in song.
      <br/>
      <strong>5</strong> The target turns into a copy of you.
      <br/>
      <strong>6</strong> The target itself turns into raw Chaos for 1D6 turns. Chaos does no harm, unless you touch it.
      <br/>
      <strong>7</strong> You turn into Chaos as above.

      <strong>8</strong> The glob does 1D4 damage per level you possess.

      The Shroud stretches through the lightless caves of the Elemental,
      the endless night of Hells, and the arctic nights of many primes.
      Your tribe was nomadic thieves, stealing to stay alive, moving

      among the dead, and suckled at the Corpse Mother’s teat (praise due
      to Her). You were sent to the Afterlives to complete your education.
      <p><em>
      No dead person will initiate hostilities against you. This does not extend to
      your companions, nor does it keep them from lying to you, informing on you,
      or overcharging you.

      You were a farrier of such skill and renown that the Kestrel Princess
      of the Seven Winds heard of you and had you abducted.
      <p><em>
      You speak the language of horses (also spoken by unicorns, zephyrs, nightmares
      and pegasi). If you need to roll when shoeing a horse (or horse-like
      creature) you roll with Advantage.

      You hatched from a crimson egg that was left in the care of the
      Sisterhood of Ptah. They raised you to explore and walk through every
      door until you found home.
      <p><em>
      Your blood holds the blessing of Ptah. You may cut yourself for 1d4 damage
      and use your blood as a universal portal key. You need to know of the portal’s
      existence and location for this to work, but not its destination.

      You piloted one of the Witch-Queen’s longships as her undead draugr
      rowed tirelessly. During one brutal raid of the world’s shores you
      slipped away.
      <p><em>
      You can talk with the undead, no matter what language they spoke in life.
      Their level of intellect greatly influences the degree to which they talk back.

      You escaped the Glass Mountain’s stultifying pleasures, and the
      automata Protectors who would keep humanity there for its own
      good. The world beyond is full of deep and wondrous chasms to explore.
      <p><em>
      The Protectors imbued you with a protective measure. You roll with Advantage
      against diseases, poisons and venoms.

      You home was the metropolis of Buer, where humans and penitent
      demons met and built a smoke-belching city of industry, speed and
      love. Of course some curious fools had to explore the cave from
      whence the demons came. You are the latest of such fools.
      <p><em>
      There is something of the lower planes about you. You roll with Advantage
      against environmental hazards of the Lower planes.

      Your world was spent, and you left with your idols, your family and
      your livestock in a silver ship to find a new home. You stole that ship,
      but then the situation was dire.
      <p><em>
      You have a poorly-understood silver ship which may fly, but has a d6 utility
      die. There must be something that unlocks its secrets and recharges its
      magic.
