    # Determine what the NPC is. Roll a d100 (or 2 d10’s with one d10 being the 10’s) to obtain
    # an NPC Modifier from Table 1. Roll a d100 to obtain an NPC Noun from Table 2. Combine the
    # two as if forming a simple sentence to describe the NPC. For example if a 21 is rolled followed
    # by a 45, the combination would read “Inept Actor.” If some facts about the NPC are previously
    # known, merely use what works and discard what does not.
