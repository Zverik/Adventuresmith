      flavor: "With interstellar transport so limited in the bulk it can move, worlds have to be
          largely self-sufficient in industry. Some worlds are more sufficient than others, however,
          and this planet has a thriving manufacturing sector capable of producing large amounts of
          goods appropriate to its tech level. The locals may enjoy a correspondingly higher
          lifestyle, or the products might be devoted towards vast projects for the aggrandizement
          of the rulers."

      name: Heavy Mining
      flavor: "This world has large stocks of valuable minerals, usually necessary for local
          industry, life support, or refinement into loads small enough to export offworld. Major

      name: Hostile Biosphere
      flavor: "The world is teeming with life, and it hates humans. Perhaps the life is xenoallergenic,

      name: Minimal Contact
      flavor: "The locals refuse most contact with offworlders. Only a small, quarantined treaty
          port is provided for offworld trade, and ships can expect an exhaustive search for
          contraband. Local governments may be trying to keep the very existence of interstellar
          trade a secret from their populations, or they may simply consider offworlders too
          dangerous or repugnant to be allowed among the population."

      name: Misandry Misogyny
      flavor: "The culture on this world holds a particular gender in contempt. Members of that
          gender are not permitted positions of formal power, and may be restricted in their

          might be floating cities, or might cling precariously to the few rocky atolls jutting up
          from the waves, or are planted as bubbles on promontories deep beneath the stormy surface.
          Survival depends on aquaculture. Planets with inedible alien life rely on gengineered Terran sea crops."

      name: Out of Contact
      flavor: "The natives have been entirely out of contact with the greater galaxy for centuries
          or longer. Perhaps the original colonists were seeking to hide from the rest of the universe,
          or the Silence destroyed any means of communication. It may have been so long that human
          origins on other worlds have regressed into a topic for legends. The players might be
          on the first offworld ship to land since the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago."

          corporation or government. Perhaps the staff is there to serve as a refueling and repair
          stop for passing ships, or to oversee an automated mining and refinery complex. They
          might be there to study ancient ruins, or simply serve as a listening and monitoring
          post for traffic through the system. The outpost is likely well-equipped with defenses

      flavor: "Before the Silence, the Perimeter was a Terran-sponsored organization charged with
          rooting out use of maltech- technology banned in human space as too dangerous for use or
          experimentation. Unbraked AIs, gengineered slave species, nanotech replicators, weapons of
          planetary destruction... the Perimeter hunted down experimenters with a great indifference
          to planetary laws. Most Perimeter Agencies collapsed during the Silence, but a few managed
          to hold on to their mission, though modern Perimeter agents often find more work as

      name: Pilgrimage Site
      flavor: "The world is noted for an important spiritual or historical location, and might be
          the sector headquarters for a widespread religion or political movement. The site attracts
          wealthy pilgrims from throughout nearby space, and those with the money necessary to manage
          interstellar travel can be quite generous to the site and its keepers. The locals tend to
          be fiercely protective of the place and its reputation, and some places may forbid the

    "Police_State":
      name: Police State
      flavor: "The world is a totalitarian police state. Any sign of disloyalty to the planet’s rulers
          is punished severely, and suspicion riddles society. Some worlds might operate by Soviet-style
          informers and indoctrination, while more technically sophisticated worlds might rely on
          omnipresent cameras or braked AI “guardian angels”. Outworlders are apt to be treated as
          a necessary evil at best, and “disappeared” if they become troublesome"

          ensuring the dissemination of human culture, history, and basic technology to frontier
          worlds that risked losing this information during the human expansion. Most frontier
          planets had an Archive where natives could learn useful technical skills in addition to
          human history and art. Those Archives that managed to survive the Silence now strive to
          send their missionaries of knowledge to new worlds in need of their lore."

    "Pretech_Cultists":
      name: Pretech Cultists

          available since the Scream. The jump gates alone were capable of crossing hundreds of
          light years in a moment, and they were just one example of the results won by blending
          psychic artifice with pretech science. Some worlds outright worship the artifacts of their
          ancestors, seeing in them the work of more enlightened and perfect humanity. These cultists
          may or may not understand the operation or replication of these devices, but they seek
          and guard them jealously."

          advanced technology. The human colonists may have a friendly or hostile relationship

      name: Psionics Fear

      name: Psionics Worship
      flavor: "These natives view psionic powers as a visible gift of god or sign of superiority.
          If the world has a functional psychic training academy, psychics occupy almost all major
          positions of power and are considered the natural and proper rulers of the world. If the
          world lacks training facilities, it is likely a hodgepodge of demented cults, with each

          training. Without this education, a potential psychic is doomed to either madness or death
          unless they refrain from using their abilities. Psionic academies are rare enough that
          offworlders are often sent there to study by wealthy patrons. The secrets of psychic
          mentorship, the protocols and techniques that allow a psychic to successfully train
          another, are carefully guarded at these academies. Most are closely affiliated with the

      name: Radioactive World
      flavor: "Whether due to a legacy of atomic warfare unhindered by nuke snuffers or a simple
          profusion of radioactive elements, this world glows in the dark. Even heavy vacc suits

          polity necessary to be a regional hegemon for the sector. Nearby worlds are likely either

      name: Restrictive Laws

          acts that are completely permissible elsewhere are punished severely here. The locals may

      name: Sealed Menace
      flavor: "Something on this planet has the potential to create enormous havoc for the inhabitants

      name: Secret Masters

      name: Sectarians
      flavor: "The world is torn by violent disagreement between sectarians of a particular faith.
          Each views the other as a damnable heresy in need of extirpation. Local government may be
          able to keep open war from breaking out, but the poisonous hatred divides communities.

          military strength, popular support or control of resources to maintain their rule.

    "Tomb_World":
      name: Tomb World

          sudden collapse of the jump gate network and the inability to bring in the massive food
          supplies required by the planet resulted in starvation, warfare, and death. Most tomb
          worlds are naturally hostile to human habitation and could not raise sufficient crops to
          maintain life. The few hydroponic facilities were usually destroyed in the fighting, and
          all that is left now are ruins, bones, and silence."

          at the nexus of several short-drill trade routes, and has facilities for easy transfer of
          valuable cargoes and the fueling and repairing of starships. The natives are accustomed to

    "Tyranny":
      name: Tyranny
      flavor: "The local government is brutal and indifferent to the will of the people. Laws may
          or may not exist, but the only one that matters is the whim of the rulers on any given day.
          Their minions swagger through the streets while the common folk live in terror of their
          appetites. The only people who stay wealthy are friends and servants of the ruling class."

    "Unbraked_AI":
      name: Unbraked AI
      flavor: "Artificial intelligences are costly and difficult to create, requiring a careful
          sequence of “growth stages” in order to bring them to sentience before artificial limits
          on cognition speed and learning development are installed. These “brakes” prevent runaway
          cognition metastasis, wherein an AI begins to rapidly contemplate certain subjects in
          increasingly baroque fashion, until they become completely crazed by rational human standards.
          This world has one such “unbraked AI” on it, probably with a witting or unwitting corps of
          servants. Unbraked AIs are quite insane, but they learn and reason with a speed impossible
          for humans, and can demonstrate a truly distressing subtlety at times."

    "Warlords":
      name: Warlords
      flavor: "The world is plagued by warlords. Numerous powerful men and women control private
          armies sufficiently strong to cow whatever local government may exist. On the lands they
          claim, their word is law. Most spend their time oppressing their own subjects and murderously
          pillaging those of their neighbors. Most like to wrap themselves in the mantle of ideology,
          religious fervor, or an ostensibly legitimate right to rule."

      name: Xenophiles
      flavor: "The natives of this world are fast friends with a particular alien race. The aliens
          may have saved the planet at some point in the past, or awed the locals with superior tech
          or impressive cultural qualities. The aliens might even be the ruling class on the planet."

    "Xenophobes":
      name: Xenophobes
      flavor: "The natives are intensely averse to dealings with outworlders. Whether through
          cultural revulsion, fear of tech contamination, or a genuine immunodeficiency, the locals
          shun foreigners from offworld and refuse to have anything to do with them beyond the bare
          necessities of contact. Trade may or may not exist on this world, but if it does, it is
          almost certainly conducted by a caste of untouchables and outcasts"
      enemies:
      - Revulsed local ruler

      - Cynical demagogue

    Zombies:
      name: Zombies
      flavor: "This menace may not take the form of shambling corpses, but some disease, alien
          artifact, or crazed local practice produces men and women with habits similar to those
          of murderous cannibal undead. These outbreaks may be regular elements in local society,
