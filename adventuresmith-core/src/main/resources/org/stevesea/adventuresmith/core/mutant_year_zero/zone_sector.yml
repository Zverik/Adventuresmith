    35-36, <h4>Settlement*</h4>
    Settlements in the Zone are uncommon and unique
    locations. There can be ruins, threats and artifacts
    in a settlement, but don’t roll them up the normal
    way. Instead, describe the sector in greater detail.
    Use the Special Zone Sectors in Chapter 15 if you
    like – all of them are settlements of different sorts.

    Airplane Wreck</h4>
    A huge metal tube lies broken and crushed on
    the ground. It is scorched by fire and inside there
    are rows of ancient seats, all blackened by flames.
    Stretching away from the tube, the ground is
    scorched and all houses destroyed, as if the tube
    had come crashing from the sky at incredible
    speed.
  - |
    Amusement Park</h4>
    A bizarre huddle of rusting machines and decrepit
    large tents, in colors that once were stark. The
    remains of the tent cloth flaps in the wind. On a
    picture, a man with a white face and a large red
    nose smiles at you. One machine is a large wooden
    disc with plastic horses mounted on it. The disc is
    placed on a motor and seems to have been able
    to rotate.
  - |
    Battlefield</h4>
    This area is completely devastated. Rusty rebars
    protrude from broken blocks of concrete that once
    were the walls of homes. The ruins are scorched
    by explosions and riddled with bullet holes. Small
    craters pockmark the ground.
  - |
    Bus Station</h4>
    Among flaking road signs with illegible numbers
    and letters, several big old motor vehicles stand
    rusting away. Some have two decks, others have an
    accordion-like contraption in the middle and can
    bend. The Ancients’ machines are truly mysterious.
  - |
    Car Park</h4>
    The concrete pillars have given in and the entire,
    circular building has collapsed like an accordion
    pressed together. In the debris, lots of motor vehicles
    from the Old Age are buried. Maybe some of
    them could be repaired?
  - |
    Church</h4>
    The ancient spire on the stone building reaches far
    into the sky, its sharp point lost in the Zone haze.
    Inside, there are rows of rotten wooden benches,
    all turned toward the figure of a man hanging on
    a cross. The Ancients used to come here to talk to
    their Boss in the sky. Now, all is quiet. If there is a
    god, it has abandoned this place long ago.
  - |
    Cinema</h4>
    Next to a large entrance leading into the dark interior
    of this building, a number of yellowing posters
    hang in huge frames. Each of the posters depict
    dramatic motifs from the Old Age. In this cavernous
    building, the Ancients watched moving images
    on a screen.
  - |
    Crater</h4>
    A gigantic hole appears in the ground, at least 50
    yards across. Some ancient weapon of annihilation
    must have struck here, destroying everything
    nearby. In the bottom of the crater, there is a small
    lake of greenish rotwater.
  - |
    Dilapidated Mansion</h4>
    This dark and decrepit house was old even before
    the Fall. It’s built of wood and stone and has somehow
    managed to withstand the decades of neglect.
    What could be hidden inside its dark halls?
  - |
    Fast Food Joint</h4>
    A large M in the shape of two dirty yellow arcs
    adorn the facade of this ruined building. There are
    many facilities like this in the Zone. What used to
    be in them no one knows any longer, but Stalkers
    tend to avoid them because of the strong Rot
    inside.
  - |
    Gas Station</h4>
    Underneath an open roof next to a low house, a
    number of car wrecks are left to rust. Next to them
    there are machines with hoses and faucets. Anyone
    who knows his way around the Zone knows that this
    is a place where the Ancients repaired their vehicles
    and filled them up with fuel.
  - |
    Highway</h4>
    The concrete is cracked and the markings on the
    road surface are all but worn away. Before the Fall,
    the Ancients would whizz by here at incredible
    speeds in their shiny motor carriages. Now, the old
    cars stand by the roadside, burnt out and rusted
    beyond repair.
  - |
    Hospital</h4>
    When the Apocalypse came, the Ancients flooded
    this concrete hulk of a building, desperately hoping
    to be saved. Now, this is a crumbling ruin. Decayed
    corpses lie everywhere in rooms and hallways, on
    beds and on the floors.
  - |
    Hunting Store</h4>
    Among the decrepit shelves in this place you can
    find fishing poles, hooks and lines. A skilled Stalker
    can use these items to find edible fish in the Zone
    waters (page 56). On the walls, yellowed pictures
    of rifles hang. In one corner, there is a heavy metal
    locker tall as a mutant – perhaps there is something
    valuable in there?
  - |
    Mall</h4>
    A city within a city reveals itself, huge halls with
    ancient shops and restaurants in several levels. Everything
    in here is scorched by fire long ago and
    covered in soot, but perhaps something valuable is
    hidden among the ashes? Here and there strange
    plastic figures stand in strange poses, as if preaching
    to a crowd.
  - |
    Marina</h4>
    Just off the shore, a great number of boat wrecks
    lie half sunken in the rotwater. Sailing boats, motor
    boats and canoes that the Ancients used for recreation
    have turned into a dangerous reef of cracked
    plastic and metal beams.
  - |
    Museum</h4>
    Large steps in broken stone lead up to this grand
    building. Inside, there are dark halls with strange
    items from the Old Age and even ages before that,
    all showcased for the Ancients to see.
  - |
    Office Building</h4>
    In this dark ruin you can find large halls, all filled
    with identical tables in small booths. On the floor,
    there are yellowed papers everywhere. Before
    the Fall, important work was probably done here.
    Now, the Zone dust blows in through the broken
    windows.
  - |
    Overgrown Park</h4>
    Tall trees and thick bushes grow wild here and have
    completely overgrown the area. Benches, walking
    paths and fountains are hidden by thick weeds and
    the lawns are turned into marshlands. There are
    many rumors about the creatures that roam the old
    parks in the Zone.
  - |
    Playground</h4>
    Car tires hang in rusty chains from a metal frame.
    A wooden sandbox has turned into a stinking pool
    of mud. Acid rains have gnawed holes in the metal
    slides long ago. Here, the Ancients played with their
    children. A few cracked plastic toys have survived
    the decades of wear and still lie abandoned in the
    sand.
  - |
    Police Station</h4>
    Outside of this large building, wrecks of identical
    blue and white cars are rusting away. The tires and
    long since gone, but the blue plastic lamps on their
    roofs are still there. In the basement of the building,
    there are rooms that cannot be opened from
    the inside.
  - |
    Radio Station</h4>
    A forest of rusty antennae and metal discs protrude
    from the roof of this massive building. A sign on
    the facade shows an antenna with rings around it.
  - |
    Residential Blocks</h4>
    Several identical tall buildings, made of concrete
    that is now cracked and crumbling. On the ground
    between these monoliths, there are rotted benches
    and tall weeds. Car wrecks are everywhere, most
    rusted beyond repair. Each of the buildings has
    a large number of identical apartments. Inside,
    you can find decrepit furniture, clothes and other
    items.
  - |
    Road Tunnel</h4>
    The entrance to this broad tunnel looks like the
    maw of an enormous beast. Outside, an innumerable
    amount of cars, trucks and buses stand tightly
    packed together, slowly rusting into nothing. Whatever
    horror the occupants of these vehicles were
    fleeing from, it is obvious few survived.
  - |
    Ruined Bridge</h4>
    The remains of a majestic bridge rise tall in the
    Zone haze. It has collapsed in both directions and
    only two thick pillars remain, but if you can climb
    up onto the remaining roadway you’ll have a great
    lookout position.
  - |
    School</h4>
    On the crumbling brick facade of this building
    hangs a clock that stopped long ago. Below it
    someone has written text on the wall, no longer
    legible. On the concrete ground in front of the
    building there are two rusty metal rods, each a
    little taller than a mutant and with a metal ring
    at the top.
  - |
    Shelter</h4>
    A massive rusty metal door in the rockside leads
    deep underground. Down there, the Ancients
    sought refuge from the horrors on the surface. Now,
    it’s a perfect place to look for artifacts. But who
    knows what’s lurking down here, who else might
    have found this dungeon full of treasure?
  - |
    Skyscraper</h4>
    A tall building rises toward the yellow haze of the
    Zone sky. The concrete is withered and broken, and
    all of the hundreds of windows have fallen from
    their frames long ago. Now, the Zone wind blows
    right through the many floors of this majestic building.
    Every floor is filled by small and identical apartments
    or offices. Only the top floor looks different,
    with bigger and more luxurious accommodations
    – if you can get all the way up there…
  - |
    Sports Center</h4>
    A large, spacious hall made of rusty corrugated
    steel. Inside, there are strange objects like thick
    mattresses covered in red plastic, large nets on
    frames, clubs with holes in them and balls in all
    colors and sizes. They say the Ancients went to
    places like this to exercise.
  - |
    Suburbia</h4>
    A street with identical small houses in even rows
    on each side. The grass and bushes have withered
    away long ago, everything is covered in ashes. Inside
    the houses, decomposing clothes and other
    personal items remain. The inhabitants must have
    left in a hurry. Car wrecks, and other remains from
    the Ancients who used to live here, abound. Much
    has decayed over time and some of the houses have
    completely collapsed.
  - |
    Subway Station</h4>
    By a stairway leading down into the underground
    a large sign with flaking paint hangs. All Stalkers
    know what this sign means. This is an entrance to
    the tunnels under the Zone. In the deeps, terrible
    dangers await – but perhaps also many untouched
    artifacts.
  - |
    Supermarket</h4>
    A grand building rises among the ruins. Its large
    windows were broken many decades ago, and the
    Zone dust drifts in unhindered. Before the Fall, this
    building housed an unimaginable amount of food,
    drink, kitchen utensils and other things that the
    Ancients consumed at a dizzying rate. Now, most
    of it is looted, burnt or decayed.
  - |
    Swimming Hall</h4>
    Inside this large ruin, there are big pools filled with
    mud and slimy algae. Noxious and toxic fumes meet
    anyone who enters. It’s hard to imagine that the
    Ancients went here voluntarily to bathe in the pools.
  - |
    Tank</h4>
    A massive and awe-inspiring metal vehicle blocks
    the path. Its enormous tracks have rusted stuck
    long ago and no death or destruction has spewed
    out from its cannon for many decades, but coming
    close to this metal beast still strikes fear into the
    heart of almost any Zone wanderer.
  - |
    Theater</h4>
    Inside of this dark ruin is a great hall, filled with
    rows of seats facing a large stage with a grand red
    curtain. The Ancients came here to see singing,
    dancing and stage plays.
  - |
    Train Station</h4>
    Ancient railway cars stand rusting on overgrown
    tracks. In these, the Ancients used to travel quickly
    and effectively all across the Zone and beyond. Now,
    the only passengers are decaying corpses.

  ruins_industry:
  - |
    1-3, Factory</h4>
    The metal roof of this large, flat building has caved
    in long ago. Inside, there are machines and strange
    vehicles with huge forks in the front. Everything in
    here is ravaged by decades of rain and wind. Some
    rusty old barrels have fallen over and a greenish
    sludge has leaked out onto the floor.
  - |
    4-6, Military Base</h4>
    A large square courtyard with brick buildings on
    each side. In the buildings, there are a great number
    of identical rooms with metal bunk beds. Beyond
    these buildings there is a large garage with several
    burnt out vehicles inside.
  - |
    7-9, Oil Cistern</h4>
    This large cylinder-shaped metal building has a
    narrow stairway winding its way around the outside
    wall, all the way to the top. Up there, you could
    spot any threats from a safe distance. The building
    contains a huge tank filled by a sticky, black liquid.
    A Gearhead could use this as fuel. The problem is
    just getting it out…
  - |
    10-12, Pipeline</h4>
    A thick rusty metal pipe runs through this part of
    the Zone. It’s wide enough for a mutant to crawl
    through. The gas and oil has stopped flowing
    through these pipes long ago. Now, they can only
    serve as scrap.
  - |
    13-15, Purification Plant</h4>
    The stench intensifies for each and every step closer
    to this building. But Stalkers know that the smell of
    decay can hide an invaluable treasure. These large
    pools, tanks and machines purified the Ancients’
    drinking water. Could there still be clean water in
    any of the tanks?
  - |
    16-18, Power Line</h4>
    A tall tower made of rusty metal beams rises into
    the Zone sky. It has collapsed halfway up, and the
    sharp spire has folded down toward the ground.
    Thick cables, that once supplied electricity to the
    entire Zone, now lie draped across the ground.
  - |
    19-21, Radio Mast</h4>
    A tall metal mast rises high above the zonescape. It
    is held up by thick metal wires, and at the top big
    rusty antennae sprout. Once, wireless transmissions
    were sent from here to the people of the Old Age,
    for their amusement and education. Now, there is
    nothing to hear but the Zone wind.
  - |
    22-24, Refinery</h4>
    An entire landscape full of rusting and decaying
    machinery covers this part of the Zone. Enormous
    tanks are connected by metal tubes, some wide
    enough for a mutant to crawl through. If you dare,
    you can climb through these metallic deadlands on
    ladders, girders and walkways.
  - |
    25-27, Rubbish Dump</h4>
    A mountain of trash blocks your path. Here, the
    Ancients dumped everything they didn’t need. Most
    has been ground to dust by the passage of time,
    but plastic items and large chunks of rusty metal
    protrude from the heap.
  - |
    28-30, Shipwreck</h4>
    A big rusty ship lies wrecked just off the shore, half
    sunken beneath the waves. The empty portholes
    make the ship look like a huge beached whale.
    Could there still be useful scrap in the engine room?
  - |
    31-33, Shooting Range</h4>
    Empty shell casings litter this large open area. In
    one end, there is a large earthwork with lots of
    pockmarks from bullets. In a shed close by there
    are targets in the shape of humans and animals. In
    the Old Age, they could afford to spend bullets on
    shooting at paper figures.
  - |
    34-36, Windmill</h4>
    A thin, white tower rises tall over the zonelands. At
    the top, a huge propeller is mounted. They say the
    Ancients started to build windmills like this one to
    get energy when the oil in the ground started to run
    out. It was much too late, of course.
