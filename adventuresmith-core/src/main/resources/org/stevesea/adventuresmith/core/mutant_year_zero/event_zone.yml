  1-4, <h5>A Beacon in the Distance</h5>
  The Zone is full of threats and dangers, but also
  of opportunities. Give the PCs something to strive
  for, to journey toward. It can be a mysterious light
  in the distance, a building that seems strangely intact,
  a gate to an ancient shelter, a group of strange
  people in the distance, or something else. For inspiration,
  have a look in Chapter 12 and Chapter
  13.

  5-8, <h5>Danger Ahead</h5>
  Just like in the Ark, you can create dramatic tension
  in the Zone by describing a looming threat,
  something unnerving at the horizon. It’s most
  effective if you have just used the Beacon in the
  Distance event above, enticing the PCs to keep going
  forward. The new threat creates an interesting
  dilemma.

  9-11, <h5>A Hard Choice</h5>
  Present a difficult dilemma to the players. It can be
  the result of the two events listed above, Beacon in
  the Distance and Danger Ahead – when they have
  some enticing goal ahead of them, place a dangerous
  threat or obstacle in their way. Will they press
  on or turn back? You can also show them two different
  things to strive for, and make them choose one
  of them – or split up. Or offer them two separate
  paths to the same goal, and let them choose which
  one to take. Few things engage players as much as
  a meaningful choice.

  12-15, <h5>Gear is Lost</h5>
  Out in the Zone, the PCs’ gear – weapons, grub, bullets
  and artifacts – can be the difference between
  life and death. If you really want to make your players
  sweat – take their stuff. But always give them
  a chance of getting it back some way.
- |
  16-18, <h5>Sleepless Night</h5>
  To keep their Wits intact, the PCs need at least
  four hours of unbroken sleep per night. It doesn’t
  sound like much, but if you disturb their sleep several
  nights in a row, it can drive them to the brink
  of desperation. In the Zone, there is much to keep
  the PCs awake at night.
- |
  19-22, <h5>A PC Gets into Trouble</h5>
  Pick one poor sod among the PCs and unleash the
  full force of the Zone on him. Let the ground give in
  underneath his feet, have him get lost in the thick
  smog of the Zone, let a monster bite into his leg and
  drag him off to a fate worse than death. Sometimes,
  just dealing some trauma to the PC will be enough.
  In any case, putting a PC on the spot will test the
  other PCs’ loyalty – what are they willing to risk to
  save their fellow mutant?
- |
  23-26, <h5>An NPC Gets into Trouble</h5>
  Try to always bring at least one NPC on every journey
  into the Zone – preferably an NPC that one or
  more PCs have a relationship to. These NPCs are
  perfect tools for creating drama in the Zone – place
  the NPC in lethal danger and the PCs react. Will
  they leave him to his fate? It is even more interesting
  if the PCs have different relationships to the
  NPC, which can mean some may want to save him
  while others would rather see him gone…
- |
  27-29, <h5>PC vs PC</h5>
  A Zone trek is always challenging and can make
  the PCs show what they’re made of. Bonds of friendship
  can be strained to the point of breaking – and
  beyond. Have a PC find an artifact that another PC
  would have more use for. Lure one PC in one direction,
  and the rest in another. Have a PC’s grub or
  artifact go missing and insinuate that an NPC that
  another PC has a relationship to is guilty of the
  theft. These kinds of events should be used with
  great care.
- |
  30-32, <h5>The Zone vs Everyone</h5>
  The Zone can divide, but it can also unite. Every
  now and then, present the PCs with an obstacle
  that they’ll need to cooperate to overcome. It can
  be a group of Zone-Ghouls they need to get past,
  a ruined building they need to go through, or acid
  rain they need to take cover from. Give the PCs the
  opportunity to use their skills and mutations for the
  good of the team.
- |
  33-36, <h5>An Unexpected Encounter</h5>
  In the wasteland that is the Zone, there are many
  enemies and threats. But if the PCs are lucky, they
  might also run into people who are friendly – or at
  least ready to negotiate. Read more about factions
  in the Zone in Chapter 13.
  <br/><br/>Let encounters with other factions be tense
  meetings. Keep the players guessing. Let the PCs
  meet a group of friendly mutants – who turn out
  to be blood-thirsty cannibals. Or let the PCs meet
  some wild Zone-Ghouls – who seek to bargain, not
  to kill. Examples
