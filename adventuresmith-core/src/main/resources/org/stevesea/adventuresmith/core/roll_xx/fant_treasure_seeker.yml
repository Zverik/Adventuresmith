  cast:
  - The Stalwart Champions of Nephren-Ka,
  - Six deserters from Queen Felicienne's Royal Guard,
  - A cadre of goblin warriors led by a Death Priest,
  - Six arrogant noblemen known as Lord Bellamy's Companions,
  - A foul-mouthed Necromancer and a Lich Prince,
  - King Delarax of Miravell, necrophiliac and plunderer,
  - Emperor Kestril, enslaver of the Hill Gnomes,
  - The thrice-damned undead thief, Glapok the Shadow,
  - Lady Khavax Unbeheld and her blind retinue,
  - Six kobold shamans and their mute orc slave,

  twist:
  - have a crude map that shows its location.
  - will immediately kill anyone else that seeks it.
  - have contracted a hideous (and soon fatal) disease.
  - believe they've found it (but all they have are baubles).
  - wish to join forces, but only if the treasure's split evenly.
  - have laid vicious traps throughout this dungeon.
  - mean to find it and destroy it with fire.
  - will offer to work together and split the bounty fifty-fifty.
  - have no interest in communicating with anyone else, or even acknowledging those that they encounter.
  - are horribly wounded, and in need of help, which they will repay with valuable information.
