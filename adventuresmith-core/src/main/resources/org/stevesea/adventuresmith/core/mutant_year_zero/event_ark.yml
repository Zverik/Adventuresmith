  1-4, <h5>Danger Ahead</h5></h5>
  A new threat appears, but not exactly where the PCs
  are. They see or hear something in the distance, or
  they learn something worrying. You can use this
  event to introduce a new Threat Card against the
  Ark (Chapter 10), or create a conflict with an existing
  NPC.
- |
  5-8, <h5>Fight over a Project</h5>
  During the Assembly (Chapter 7), the players decide
  which projects the People will undertake. Having
  NPCs try to sabotage or control the projects is usually
  an effective way to engage players.
- |
  9-12, <h5>A Threat Escalates</h5>
  Each of the 25 Threat Cards describes an internal or
  external threat to the Ark. These threats usually cannot
  be ignored by anyone in the Ark, nor by the PCs.
  In Chapter 10, these threats are described in more
  detail, with suggestions on how to escalate them.
  <br/><br/>You will usually draw or roll up a new threat at
  the start of each session, but you can escalate them
  whenever you want. Always try to make the threats
  personal. Let them affect the PCs, or NPCs who are
  important to them, in some concrete way.

  13-15, <h5>Fight over Gear</h5>
  In Mutant: Year Zero, the PCs’ grub, bullets, weapons
  and other gear can make the difference between
  life and death. Want to instantly increase the intensity
  of a gaming session? Have an NPC try to steal
  a PC’s gear. It can be a stealthy theft leading to a
  frantic chase for the perpetrator, or brute robbery.
- |
  16-19, <h5>An Appealing Offer</h5>
  The PCs’ personal goals are central in this game,
  but a juicy offer from some NPC can also create
  drama. It can be simple missions in the Ark or in
  the Zone, it can be trades with artifacts and other
  gear. Make sure there is catch to every deal, something
  that gives the PC cause to hesitate. Maybe
  the risks are too great, the price too high or maybe
  the deal will get another NPC or PC into trouble.
- |
  20-23, <h5>A PC Gets into Trouble</h5>
  Pick one PC, and shower him with misery. Maybe
  he gets scammed trying to strike a deal, robbed in a
  dark corner of the Ark or threatened by a powerful
  Boss. Will the other PCs stand by his side, or leave
  him to fend for himself? Your best tool for events
  of this type are NPCs who the PC hates from the
  start of the game, or made enemies with along the
  way.
- |
  24-27, <h5>An NPC Gets into Trouble</h5>
  All PCs have enemies – but they also have people they
  care about and need to protect. The players established
  who these people are when they created their
  characters (Chapter 2). If you want to create instant
  drama, pick one of these NPCs and threaten to kill
  him – or worse. This should make the player spring
  into action! And should he choose to leave his friends
  to a horrible fate, he will soon realize he will be very
  alone when he is in trouble himself.

  28-30, <h5>PC vs PC</h5>
  The PCs may be friends, but in the world of Mutant,
  all friendship is tested – sooner or later. The most effective
  way to make PCs turn on each other is to use
  an NPC that both PCs have some relationship to.
  Other methods include spreading rumors in the Ark,
  or giving something to a PC that you know another
  PC really wants. But be careful – you don’t want a
  conflict between PCs to become a conflict between
  players. Be sure to know your gaming group well
  before you use this type of event.

  31-33, <h5>Unwanted Consequences</h5>
  The Ark is a small and fragile society. Everything
  the PCs do will have consequences – sometimes
  not the ones they expect. Sometimes these consequences
  will be immediate and obvious for all to
  see, other times the fallout of a particular action can
  come much later. Creating new scenes and challenges
  based on what a PC has done earlier is a
  very effective way to create drama and engage the
  players in the story
- |
  34-36, <h5>A Glimpse of the Dream</h5>
  Every PC has a “big dream” (Chapter 2). The dream
  is something that seems distant, something the PCs
  fantasize about when the realities of life are too
  hard to bear. But every now and then, a PC can get
  a little glimpse of his dream – the beginning of a
  path that maybe, just maybe, might lead to all the
  way there.
