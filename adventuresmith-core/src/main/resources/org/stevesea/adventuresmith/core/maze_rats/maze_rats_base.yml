# lots of the MR tables inter-relate, but it's handy to have them all as separate YaML files for
# housekeeping (and translation). Split them all into separate yaml files, but include them all
# in this file, now all the generator files can just import maze_rats_base and get all the tables
# and not have to pick and choose (and potentially get undefined keys)
imports:
- mr_magic
