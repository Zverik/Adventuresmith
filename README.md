## Overview

Adventuresmith is an Android app for randomly generating elements for tabletop RPGs (names, spells,
items, monsters, characters, alien worlds, etc). Adventuresmith is free, and ad-free (and will remain so).

Adventuresmith software is licensed under the GPL. Depending on the source of the content, the
licensing terms of the content within Adventuresmith varies -- see [this section](#content) for
content attribution and information about the content within the app.

### How to use the app
Random tables are a great tool to provide a framework for improvisation.

During game prep or in-game, if you have a choice of:

> "you meet a person in the city, who are they?"

or

![alt text](https://github.com/stevesea/Adventuresmith/raw/master/docs/images/npc_sample.png "sample NPC")

the second gives you many more hooks to help you create a memorable character to interact with
your players.

Or, if you decide your party encounters a humanoid in the woods...

... would you have come up with an asthmatic half-orc bandit, laying a trap?
