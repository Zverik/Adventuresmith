## Overview

Adventuresmith is an Android app for randomly generating elements for tabletop RPGs (names, spells,
items, monsters, characters, alien worlds, etc). Adventuresmith is free, and ad-free (and will remain so).

Adventuresmith software is licensed under the GPL. The licensing terms of the content within
Adventuresmith varies, depending on the source of the data. See [this section](#content) for content

the second gives you many more hooks to help you create a memorable character to interact with
your players.

Or, if you decide your party encounters a humanoid in the woods...

... would you have come up with an asthmatic half-orc bandit, laying a trap?
